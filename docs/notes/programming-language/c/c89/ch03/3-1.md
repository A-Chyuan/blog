# Statements and Blocks

An **expression** such as `x = 0` or `i++` or `printf(...)` becomes a **statement** when it is followed by a semicolon (`;`), as in

```c
x = 0;
i++;
printf(...);
```

In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it is in languages like Pascal.

A statement specifies <mark>an action to be performed.</mark> Except as indicated, statements are executed in sequence.

## Blocks

Braces `{` and `}` are used to group declarations and statements together into a **compound statement**, or **block**, so that they are <mark>syntactically equivalent to a single statement</mark>.

The braces that surround the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple statements after an `if`, `else`, `while`, or `for` are another. (Variables can be declared inside *any* block; we will talk about this in Chapter 4.)

There is no semicolon after the right brace that ends a block.

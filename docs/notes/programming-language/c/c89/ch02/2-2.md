在 C89 規格書中，此章節為 [C89 &sect;3.5.2 Type specifiers][] 的一部分，與 [C89 &sect;3.5.3 Type qualifiers] 不同。儘管 K&R 使用 Qualifiers 一詞。

# Data Types and Sizes

## Basic Data Types

There are only a few basic data types in C:

| Type     | Description                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `char`   | A single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set.        |
| `int`    | An integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine. |
| `float`  | Single-precision floating point.                                                   |
| `double` | Double-precision floating point.                                                   |

In addition, there are a number of qualifiers that can be applied to these basic types.

## Qualifiers

$$
\text{Qualifiers}
\begin{cases}
    & \text{Size}
    & \begin{cases}
        & \text{short} \\
        & \text{long}
    \end{cases}
    \\\\
    & \text{Signed}
    & \begin{cases}
        & \text{signed} \\
        & \text{unsigned}
    \end{cases}
\end{cases}
$$

### Size Qualifiers

#### Integer Types

`short` and `long` apply to integers:

```c
short int sh;
long int counter;
```

The word `int` can be omitted in such declarations, and typically it is:

```c
short sh;
long counter;
```

The intent is that `short` and `long` should provide different lengths of integers where practical;

- `int` will normally be the natural size for a particular machine.
- `short` is often 16 bits long,
- and `int` either 16 or 32 bits.

<mark>Each compiler is free to choose appropriate sizes for its own hardware</mark>, subject only to the the restriction that

- `short`s and `int`s are at least 16 bits,
- `long`s are at least 32 bits,
- and `short` is no longer than `int`, which is no longer than `long`.

Besides the minimal bit counts, the C Standard guarantees that:

1 $==$ `sizeof(char)` $\leq$ `sizeof(short)` $\leq$ `sizeof(int)` $\leq$ `sizeof(long)`

#### Real Floating-Point Types

As with integers, the sizes of floating-point objects are *implementation-defined*.

- `float`: single-precision floating-point
- `double`: double-precision floating-point
- `long double`: extended-precision floating-point

These three types could represent one, two or three distinct sizes.

### Signed and Unsigned Qualifiers

The qualifier `signed` or `unsigned` may be applied to `char` or any integer.

`unsigned` numbers are always positive or zero, and obey the laws of arithmetic modulo $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits in the type.

<div class="alert-example">

If `char`s are 8 bits,

- `unsigned char` variables have values between 0 and 255.
- `signed char` variables have values between -128 and 127 (in a two's complement machine).

</div>

- Plain `char`s are signed or unsigned is *machine-dependent*

  ?> See also: [2-7 &sect;Plain Char][]

- Printable characters are always positive, e.g. [ASCII printable characters][]

## Numerical Limits

The standard headers [<limits.h>][] and [<float.h>][] contain symbolic constants for all of these sizes, along with other properties of the machine and compiler.

[<limits.h>]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/limits
[<float.h>]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/limits#Limits_of_floating-point_types

```c
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    /* char */
    printf("Size of char %d\n", CHAR_BIT);
    printf("Size of char Min %d\n", CHAR_MIN);
    printf("Size of char Max %d\n", CHAR_MAX);
    printf("Size of unsigned char %u\n", UCHAR_MAX);

    /* int */
    printf("Size of int min %d\n", INT_MIN);
    printf("Size of int max %d\n", INT_MAX);
    printf("Size of unsigned int %u\n", UINT_MAX);

    /* long */
    printf("Size of long min %ld\n", LONG_MIN);
    printf("Size of long max %ld\n", LONG_MAX);
    printf("Size of unsigned long %lu\n", ULONG_MAX);

    /* short */
    printf("Size of short min %d\n", SHRT_MIN);
    printf("Size of short max %d\n", SHRT_MAX);
    printf("Size of unsigned short %u\n", USHRT_MAX);

    return 0;
}
```

# Register Variables

A `register` declaration advises the compiler that the variable in question will be heavily used. The idea is that <mark>`register` variables are to be placed in machine registers</mark>, which may result in smaller and faster programs.

But compilers are free to ignore the advice.

<div class="alert-example">

The `register` declaration looks like

```c
register int x;
register char c;
```

and so on.

</div>

The `register` declaration can only be applied to automatic variables and to the formal parameters of a function.

<div class="alert-example">

In this later case, it looks like

```c
f(register unsigned m, register long n)
{
    register int i;
    ...
}
```

</div>

## Restrictions

In practice, there are restrictions on register variables, reflecting the realities of underlying hardware. Only a few variables in each function may be kept in registers, and only certain types are allowed.

Excess register declarations are harmless, however, since the word `register` is ignored for excess or disallowed declarations.

<div class="alert-attention">

And it is not possible to take the *address* of a register variable (a topic covered in Chapter 5), regardless of whether the variable is actually placed in a register.

</div>

The specific restrictions on number and types of register variables vary from machine to machine.

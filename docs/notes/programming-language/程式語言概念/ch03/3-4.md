# Attribute Grammars

An **attribute grammar** is a device used to describe more of the structure of a programming language than can be described with a context-free grammar.

An attribute grammar is an *extension* to a context-free grammar. The extension allows certain language rules to be conveniently described, such as type compatibility.

## Static Semantics

***Limitations of BNF***

There are <mark>some characteristics</mark> of programming languages that <mark>are difficult to describe with BNF</mark>, and some that are impossible.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider type compatibility rules. In Java, a floating-point value cannot be assigned to an integer type variable, although the opposite is legal

- Although this restriction can be specified in BNF, it requires additional nonterminal symbols and rules.
- If all of the typing rules of Java were specified in BNF, the grammar would become too large to be useful, because the size of the grammar determines the size of the syntax analyzer.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

As an example of a syntax rule that cannot be specified in BNF, consider the common rule that all variables must be declared before they are referenced.

It has been proven that this rule cannot be specified in BNF.

</div>

***Static Semantics Rules***

These problems exemplify the categories of language rules called **static semantics rules**.

- The static semantics of a language is only indirectly related to the meaning of programs during execution; rather, it has to do with the legal forms of programs (syntax rather than semantics).
- Many static semantic rules of a language state its type constraints.
- Static semantics is so named because the analysis required to check these specifications can be done at compile time.

***Attribute Grammars***

Because of the problems of describing static semantics with BNF, **attribute grammars** have been devised to describe both the syntax and the static semantics of programs.

- Attribute grammars are a formal approach both to describing and checking the correctness of the static semantics rules of a program.
- Although they are not always used in a formal way in compiler design, the basic concepts of attribute grammars are at least informally used in every compiler.

Dynamic semantics, which is the meaning of expressions, statements, and program units, is discussed in Section 3.5.

## Basic Concepts

Attribute grammars are context-free grammars to which have been added

- **Attributes**, which are associated with grammar symbols (the terminal and nonterminal symbols), are similar to variables in the sense that they can have values assigned to them.
- **Attribute computation functions**, sometimes called semantic functions, are associated with grammar rules. They are used to specify how attribute values are computed.
- **Predicate functions**, which state the static semantic rules of the language, are associated with grammar rules.

## Attribute Grammars Defined

An attribute grammar is a grammar with the following additional features:

- Associated with each grammar symbol $X$ is a set of attributes $A(X)$, which consists of two disjoint sets

    - **Synthesized attributes**: $S(X)$ pass semantic information *up* a parse tree.
    - **inherited attributes**: $I(X)$ pass semantic information *down* and *across* a tree.

- Associated with each grammar rule is a set of *semantic functions* and a possibly empty set of *predicate functions* over the attributes of the symbols in the grammar rule.

    For a rule the $X_0 \rightarrow X_1 \dots X_n$ ,

    - Synthesized attributes of $X_0$ are computed with *semantic functions* of the form $S(X_0) = f(A(X_1), \dots, A(X_n))$. So the value of a synthesized attribute on a parse tree node depends only on the values of the attributes on that node’s *children* nodes.

    - Inherited attributes of symbols $X_j, 1 \leq j \leq n$ (in the rule above), are computed with a *semantic function* of the form $I(X_j) = f(A(X_0), \dots, A(X_n))$. So the value of an inherited attribute on a parse tree node depends on the attribute values of that node’s *parent* node and those of its *sibling* nodes.

        <div class="alert-note">

        To *avoid circularity*, inherited attributes are often restricted to functions of the form $I(X_j) = f(A(X_0), \dots, A(X_{j - 1}))$. This form prevents an inherited attribute from depending on itself or on attributes to the right in the parse tree.

        </div>

- A predicate function has the form of a *Boolean expression* on the union of the attribute set ${A(X_0), \dots, A(X_n)}$ and a set of literal attribute values.

    - The only derivations allowed with an attribute grammar are those in which every predicate associated with every nonterminal is *true*.
    - A *false* predicate function value indicates a violation of the syntax or static semantics rules of the language.

---

- <mark>A parse tree of an attribute grammar is the parse tree based on its underlying BNF grammar, with a possibly empty set of attribute values attached to each node.</mark>
- If all the attribute values in a parse tree have been computed, the tree is said to be **fully attributed**.
- Although in practice it is not always done this way, it is convenient to think of attribute values as being computed after the complete unattributed parse tree has been constructed by the compiler.

## Intrinsic Attributes

**Intrinsic attributes** are synthesized attributes of leaf nodes whose values are determined *outside* the parse tree.

<div class="alert-example">

The type of an instance of a variable in a program could come from the symbol table, which is used to store variable names and their types. The contents of the symbol table are set based on earlier declaration statements.

</div>

- <mark>Initially</mark>, assuming that an unattributed parse tree has been constructed and that attribute values are needed, <mark>the only attributes with values are the intrinsic attributes of the *leaf* nodes.</mark>
- Given the intrinsic attribute values on a parse tree, the semantic functions can be used to compute the remaining attribute values.

## Examples of Attribute Grammars

<div class="alert-example">

?> How attribute grammars can be used to describe static semantics:

Consider the following fragment of an attribute grammar that describes the rule that the name on the `end` of an Ada procedure must match the procedure’s name. (This rule cannot be stated in BNF.)

```ada
procedure Hello is
begin
    Put_Line ("Hello, World!");
end Hello;
```

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Syntax Rule}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <proc\_def> → procedure <proc\_name>[1]
\state $\hspace{8.5em}$ <proc\_body> end <proc\_name>[2];

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Predicate}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <proc\_name>[1].string == <proc\_name>[2].string

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The string attribute of `<proc_name>`, denoted by `<proc_name>.string`, is the actual string of characters that were found immediately following the reserved word `procedure` by the compiler.

<div class="alert-attention">

Notice that when there is more than one occurrence of a nonterminal in a syntax rule in an attribute grammar, the nonterminals are subscripted with brackets (`[]`) to distinguish them. Neither the subscripts nor the brackets are part of the described language.

</div>

In this example, the predicate rule states that the name string attribute of the
`<proc_name>` nonterminal in the subprogram header must match the name string
attribute of the `<proc_name>` nonterminal following the end of the subprogram.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> How an attribute grammar can be used to check the type rules of a simple assignment statement:

<details>

<summary>

The syntax and static semantics of this assignment statement are as follows:

</summary>

- The only variable names are `A`, `B`, and `C`.
- The right side of the assignments can be either a variable or an expression in the form of a variable added to another variable.
- The variables can be one of two types: `int` or `real`.
- When there are two variables on the right side of an assignment, they need not be the same type.
- The type of the expression when the operand types are not the same is always real. When they are the same, the expression type is that of the operands.
- The type of the left side of the assignment must match the type of the right side. So the types of operands in the right side can be mixed, but the assignment is valid only if the target and the value resulting from evaluating the right side have the same type.
- The attribute grammar specifies these static semantic rules.

</details>

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The syntax portion of our example attribute grammar is}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <assign> → <var> = <expr>
\state <expr> → <var> + <var>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <var>
\state <var> → A | B | C

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The attributes for the nonterminals in the example attribute grammar are described in the following paragraphs:

- `actual_type`—A *synthesized attribute* associated with the nonterminals `<var>` and `<expr>`.

    - It is used to store the actual type, `int` or `real`, of a variable or expression.
    - In the case of a variable, the actual type is intrinsic.
    - In the case of an expression, it is determined from the actual types of the child node or children nodes of the `<expr>` nonterminal.

- `expected_type`—An *inherited attribute* associated with the nonterminal `<expr>`.

    It is used to store the type, either `int` or `real`, that is expected for the expression, as determined by the type of the variable on the left side of the assignment statement.

The complete attribute grammar:

## Computing Attribute Values

Now, consider the process of computing the attribute values of a parse tree, which is sometimes called **decorating** the parse tree.

- If all attributes were inherited, this could proceed in a completely top-down order, from the root to the leaves.
- Alternatively, it could proceed in a completely bottom-up order, from the leaves to the root, if all the attributes were synthesized.
- Because our grammar has both synthesized and inherited attributes, the evaluation process cannot be in any single direction.

Determining attribute evaluation order for the general case of an attribute grammar is a complex problem, requiring the construction of a *dependency graph* to show all attribute dependencies.

<div class="alert-example">

?> Continuing from the previous example.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{An Evaluation of the Attributes}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state The following is an evaluation of the attributes,\\in an order in which it is possible to compute them: \\\\

\state 1. <var>.actual\_type ← look-up(A) (Rule 4)
\state 2. <expr>.expected\_type ← <var>.actual\_type (Rule 1)
\state 3. <var>[2].actual\_type ← look-up(A) (Rule 4)
\state $\hspace{0.8em}$ <var>[3].actual\_type ← look-up(B) (Rule 4)
\state 4. <expr>.actual\_type ← either int or real (Rule 2)
\state 5. <expr>.expected\_type == <expr>.actual\_type is either TRUE or FALSE (Rule 2)

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

## Evaluation

Checking the static semantic rules of a language is an essential part of all compilers.

Even if a compiler writer has never heard of an attribute grammar, he or she would need to use the fundamental ideas of attribute grammars to design the checks of static semantics rules for his or her compiler.

One of the main difficulties in using an attribute grammar to describe all of the syntax and static semantics of a real contemporary programming language is

- The size and complexity of the attribute grammar.
- The large number of attributes and semantic rules required for a complete programming language make such grammars difficult to write and read.
- Furthermore, the attribute values on a large parse tree are costly to evaluate.

# Formal Methods of Describing Syntax

This section discusses the formal *language-generation mechanisms*, usually called **grammars**, that are commonly used to describe the syntax of programming languages.

## Backus-Naur Form and Context-Free Grammars

**Backus-Naur Form (BNF)**, which is *equivalent to* **context-free grammars**, is a *syntax description* formalism and the most widely used method for programming language syntax.

?> In the remainder of the chapter, we refer to *context-free grammars* simply *as grammars*. Furthermore, the terms BNF and grammar are used interchangeably.

### Context-Free Grammars

- Developed by Noam Chomsky in the mid-1950s.
- Language generators, meant to describe the syntax of *natural languages*.
- Define a class of languages called context-free languages.

Two types of *Chomsky hierarchy* are useful for describing the syntax of programming languages:

- The forms of the tokens of programming languages can be described by **regular grammars**.
- The syntax of whole programming languages, with minor exceptions, can be described by **context-free grammars**.

### Origins of Backus-Naur Form

- Invented by John Backus to describe the syntax of Algol 58.
- BNF is equivalent to context-free grammars.

### Fundamentals

A **metalanguage** is a language that is used to describe another language. BNF is a metalanguage for programming languages.

BNF uses *abstractions* for syntactic structures.

<div class="alert-example">

A simple Java *assignment statement* might be represented by the abstraction `<assign>` (pointed brackets are often used to delimit names of abstractions).

The actual definition of `<assign>` can be given by

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Java Assignment Statement Rule}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <assign> → <var> = <expression>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

- The text on the left side of the arrow, which is aptly called the **left-hand side (LHS)**, is the abstraction being defined.
- The text to the right of the arrow is the definition of the LHS. It is called the **right-hand side (RHS)** and consists of some mixture of tokens, lexemes, and references to other abstractions. (Actually, tokens are also abstractions.)
- Altogether, the definition is called a **rule**, or **production**.

In the example rule just given, the abstractions `<var>` and `<expression>` obviously must be defined for the `<assign>` definition to be useful.

This particular rule specifies that the abstraction `<assign>` is defined as

- an instance of the abstraction `<var>`,
- followed by the lexeme `=`,
- followed by an instance of the abstraction `<expression>`.

One example sentence whose syntactic structure is described by the rule is

```java
total = subtotal1 + subtotal2
```

</div>

- The *abstractions* in a BNF description, or grammar, are often called **nonterminal symbols**, or simply **nonterminals**.

    Nonterminal symbols can have two or more distinct definitions, representing two or more possible syntactic forms in the language.

- The *lexemes* and *tokens* of the rules are called **terminal symbols**, or simply **terminals**.
- A BNF description, or **grammar**, is a collection of rules.

Multiple definitions can be written as a single rule, with the different definitions separated by the symbol `|`, meaning *logical OR*.

<div class="alert-example">

A Java `if` statement can be described with the rules

[](./embed/example-if-else-rule.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

In these rules, `<stmt>` represents either a single statement or a compound statement.

</div>

Although BNF is simple, it is sufficiently powerful to describe nearly all of the syntax of programming languages. In particular, it can describe

- Lists of similar constructs.
- the order in which different constructs must appear.
- Nested structures to any depth.
- Even imply operator precedence and operator associativity.

### Describing Lists

- Variable-length lists in mathematics are often written using an ellipsis ( … ); 1, 2, … is an example.
- BNF does not include the ellipsis, so an alternative method is required for describing lists of syntactic elements in programming languages.

For BNF, the alternative is recursion. A rule is **recursive** if its LHS appears in its RHS.

<div class="alert-example">

A list of identifiers appearing on a data declaration statement

[](./embed/example-list-rule-recursion.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

This defines `<ident_list>` as either a single token (identifier) or an identifier followed by a comma and another instance of `<ident_list>`.

</div>

### Grammars and Derivations

- A grammar is a *generative device* for defining languages.
- The sentences of the language are generated through a sequence of applications of the rules, beginning with a special nonterminal of the grammar called the **start symbol**.

    In a grammar for a complete programming language, the start symbol represents a complete program and is often named `<program>`.

- This sequence of rule applications is called a **derivation**.

?> The derivation continues *until* the sentential form contains *no nonterminals*. That sentential form, consisting of only terminals, or lexemes, is the generated sentence.

**Derivation order** has no effect on the language generated by a grammar. A derivation may be

- Leftmost (The replaced nonterminal is the leftmost nonterminal in the previous sentential form.)
- Rightmost
- Or neither

---

- By choosing alternative RHSs of rules with which to replace nonterminals in the derivation, different sentences in the language can be generated.
- By exhaustively choosing all combinations of choices, the entire language can be generated.
- This language, like most others, is infinite, so one cannot generate all the sentences in the language in finite time.

<div class="alert-example">

A simple grammar is used to illustrate derivations:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{A Grammar for a Small Language}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <program> → begin <stmt\_list> end
\state <stmt\_list> → <stmt>
\state $\hspace{6.35em}$ | <stmt> ; <stmt\_list>
\state <stmt> → <var> = <expression>
\state <var> → A | B | C
\state <expression> → <var> + <var>
\state $\hspace{7em}$ | <var> $-$ <var>
\state $\hspace{7em}$ | <var>
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The language described by the grammar has only one statement form: assignment.

- A program consists of the special word `begin`, followed by a list of statements separated by semicolons, followed by the special word `end`.
- An expression is either a single variable or two variables separated by either a `+` or `-` operator.
- The only variable names in this language are `A`, `B`, and `C`.

A derivation of a program in this language follows:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Example of Derivation (Leftmost)}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <program> => begin <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin <stmt> ; <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin <var> = <expression> ; <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = <expression> ; <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = <var> + <var> ; <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + <var> ; <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + C ; <stmt\_list> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + C; <stmt> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + C ; <var> = <expression> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + C ; B = <expression> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + C ; B = <var> end
\state $\hspace{5.45em}$ => begin A = B + C ; B = C end

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

- This derivation, like all derivations, begins with the start symbol, in this case `<program>`.
- The symbol `=>` is read “derives.” Each successive string in the sequence is derived from the previous string by replacing one of the nonterminals with one of that nonterminal’s definitions.
- Each of the strings in the derivation, including `<program>`, is called a **sentential form**.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{A Grammar for Simple Assignment Statements}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <assign> → <id> = <expr>
\state <id> → A | B | C
\state <expr> → <id> + <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <id> * <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | ( <expr>)
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <id>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

This grammar describes assignment statements whose right sides are arithmetic expressions with multiplication and addition operators and parentheses. For example, the statement

```
A = B * ( A + C )
```

is generated by:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Derivation (Leftmost)}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <assign> => <id> = <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = <id> * <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = B * <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = B * ( <expr>)
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = B * ( <id> + <expr>)
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = B * ( A + <expr>)
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = B * ( A + <id>)
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ => A = B * ( A + C )

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

</div>

### Parse Trees

One of the most attractive features of grammars is that they naturally describe the hierarchical syntactic structure of the sentences of the languages they define. These hierarchical structures are called **parse trees**.

![](./img/3.1.jpg ':figure :size=50% A parse tree for the simple statement A = B * (A + C).')

- Every internal node of a parse tree is labeled with a nonterminal symbol.
- Every leaf is labeled with a terminal symbol.
- Every subtree of a parse tree describes one instance of an abstraction in the sentence.

### Ambiguity

A grammar that generates a sentential form for which there are *two or more distinct parse trees* is said to be **ambiguous**.

<div class="alert-example">

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{An Ambiguous Grammar for Simple Assignment Statements}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <assign> → <id> = <expr>
\state <id> → A | B | C
\state <expr> → <expr> + <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.35em}$ | <expr> * <expr>
\state $\hspace{4.35em}$ | ( <expr> )
\state $\hspace{4.35em}$ | <id>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The grammar is ambiguous because the sentence

```
A = B + C * A
```

has two distinct parse trees.

![](./img/3.2.jpg ':figure Two distinct parse trees for the same sentence, A = B + C * A.')

The ambiguity occurs because the grammar specifies slightly less syntactic structure.

</div>

Syntactic ambiguity of language structures is a problem because

- Compilers often <mark>base</mark> the *semantics* of those structures <mark>on their syntactic form</mark>.
- Specifically, the compiler chooses the code to be generated for a statement by examining its *parse tree*.
- If a language structure has more than one parse tree, then the meaning of the structure can*not* be determined *uniquely*.

In many cases, an ambiguous grammar can be rewritten to be unambiguous but still generate the desired language.

#### Determining Whether a Grammar is Ambiguous

There are several other characteristics of a grammar that are sometimes useful in determining whether a grammar is ambiguous. They include the following:

1. If the grammar generates a sentence with *more than one* leftmost derivation.
2. If the grammar generates a sentence with *more than one* rightmost derivation.

Some parsing algorithms can be based on ambiguous grammars. When such a parser encounters an ambiguous construct, it uses nongrammatical information provided by the designer to construct the correct parse tree.

### Operator Precedence

When an expression includes two different operators, one obvious semantic issue is the order of evaluation of the two operators.

<div class="alert-example">

```
x + y * z
```

In this expression is it add and then multiply, or vice versa?

</div>

This semantic question can be answered by assigning different precedence levels to operators.

<div class="alert-example">

If `*` has been assigned higher precedence than `+` (by the language designer), multiplication will be done first, regardless of the order of appearance of the two operators in the expression.

</div>

As stated previously, a grammar can describe a certain syntactic structure so that part of the <mark>meaning of the structure can be determined from its parse tree.</mark>

In particular, the fact that an operator in an arithmetic expression is generated lower in the parse tree (and therefore must be evaluated first) can be used to indicate that it has precedence over an operator produced higher up in the tree.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/3.2.jpg ':figure Two distinct parse trees for the same sentence, A = B + C * A.')

- In the first parse tree, the multiplication operator is generated lower in the tree, which could indicate that it has precedence over the addition operator in the expression.
- The second parse tree, however, indicates just the opposite.

It appears, therefore, that the two parse trees indicate *conflicting precedence* information.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose a parse tree of a sentence with multiple operators, regardless of the particular operators involved, has the rightmost operator in the expression at the lowest point in the parse tree, with the other operators in the tree moving progressively higher as one moves to the left in the expression.

- In the expression `A + B * C`, `*` is the lowest in the tree, indicating it is to be done first.
- However, in the expression `A * B + C`, `+` is the lowest, indicating it is to be done first.

</div>

A grammar can be written for the simple expressions we have been discussing that is both *unambiguous* and specifies a *consistent precedence* of the `+` and `*` operators, regardless of the order in which the operators appear in an expression.

- The correct ordering is specified by using separate nonterminal symbols to represent the operands of the operators that have different precedence.
- This requires *additional nonterminals* and some *new rules*.

<div class="alert-example">

Instead of using `<expr>` for both operands of both `+` and `*`, we could use three nonterminals to represent operands, which allows the grammar to force different operators to different levels in the parse tree.

1. If `<expr>` is the root symbol for expressions, `+` can be forced to the top of the parse tree by having `<expr>` directly generate only `+` operators, using the new nonterminal, `<term>`, as the right operand of `+`.
2. Next, we can define `<term>` to generate `*` operators, using `<term>` as the left operand and a new nonterminal, `<factor>`, as its right operand.
3. Now, `*` will always be lower in the parse tree, simply because it is farther from the start symbol than `+` in every derivation.

[](./embed/example-3.4.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

The grammar generates the same language, but it is unambiguous and it specifies the usual precedence order of multiplication and addition operators.

[](./embed/example-3.4.1.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

The unique parse tree:

![](./img/3.3.jpg ':figure :size=50% The unique parse tree for A = B + C * A using an unambiguous grammar.')

</div>

The *connection* between parse trees and derivations is very close:

- Either can easily be constructed from the other.
- <mark>Every derivation with an unambiguous grammar has a unique parse tree, although that tree can be represented by different derivations.</mark>

<div class="alert-example">

The following derivation of the sentence `A = B + C * A` is different from the derivation of the same sentence given previously.

- This is a rightmost derivation, whereas the previous one is leftmost.
- Both of these derivations, however, are represented by the *same* parse tree.

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:Rightmost -->

<!-- tab:Leftmost -->

[](./embed/example-3.4.1.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

<!-- tab:Grammar -->

<!-- tab:Same Parse Tree -->

![](./img/3.3.jpg ':figure :size=50% The unique parse tree for A = B + C * A using an unambiguous grammar.')

<!-- tabs:end -->

</div>

### Associativity of Operators

When an expression includes two operators that have the *same precedence*, a semantic rule is required to specify which should have precedence. This rule is named **associativity**.

<div class="alert-example">

```
A / B * C
```

`*` and `/` usually have same precedence.

As was the case with precedence, a grammar for expressions may correctly imply operator associativity.

Consider the following example of an assignment statement:

```
A = B + C + A
```

The parse tree for this sentence:

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:Parse Tree -->

![](./img/3.4.jpg ':figure :size=40% A parse tree for A = B + C + A illustrating the associativity of addition.')

<!-- tab:Grammar -->

[](./embed/example-3.4.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

<!-- tabs:end -->

The left addition operator lower than the right addition operator. This is the correct order if addition is meant to be left associative, which is typical.

</div>

- In mathematics, addition is associative, which means that left and right associative orders of evaluation mean the same thing. That is, $(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)$.
- Floating-point addition in a computer, however, is *not* necessarily associative.

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose floating-point values store *seven digits of accuracy*.

- Left associative:

$$
\begin{align}
  \ & (10^7 + 1) + \dots + 1 \\
= \ & (1.000000 \times 10^7 + 1 ) + \dots + 1 \\
= \ & (\overbrace{1.000000}^{\text{7 digits}}\underline{1} \times 10^7) + \dots + 1 \\
= \ & (1.000000 \times 10^7) + \dots + 1 \\
= \ & 1.000000 \times 10^7
\end{align}
$$

- Right associative:

$$
\begin{align}
  \ & 10^7 + (\overbrace{1 + \dots + 1}^{\text{Ten 1's}}) \\
= \ & 1.000000 \times 10^7 + (\overbrace{1 + \dots + 1}^{\text{Ten 1's}}) \\
= \ & 1.000000 \times 10^7 + 10 \\
= \ & 1.000000\underline{1} \times 10^7
\end{align}
$$

Subtraction and division are not associative, whether in mathematics or in a computer. Therefore, <mark>correct associativity may be essential for an expression</mark> that contains either of them.

</div>

When a grammar rule has its LHS also appearing at the *beginning* of its RHS, the rule is said to be **left recursive**. This left recursion specifies *left associativity*.

<div class="alert-example">

The left recursion of the rules of the grammar of example

[](./embed/example-3.4.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

causes it to make both addition and multiplication left associative.

</div>

Unfortunately, left recursion disallows the use of some important syntax analysis algorithms.

- When one of these algorithms is to be used, the grammar must be modified to remove the left recursion.
- This, in turn, disallows the grammar from precisely specifying that certain operators are left associative.
- Fortunately, left associativity can be enforced by the compiler, even though the grammar does not dictate it.

A grammar rule is **right recursive** if the LHS appears at the right *end* of the RHS.

<div class="alert-example">

In most languages that provide it, the exponentiation operator is right associative. To indicate right associativity, right recursion can be used.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Describe Exponentiation as a Right-Associative Operator}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <factor> → <exp> ** <factor>
\state $\hspace{5em}$ | <exp>
\state <exp> → ( <expr> )
\state $\hspace{3.95em}$ | id

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

</div>

### An Unambiguous Grammar for if-else

The BNF rules for a Java `if-else` statement are as follows:

[](./embed/example-if-else-rule.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

If we also have `<stmt> → <if_stmt>`, this grammar is ambiguous.

[](./embed/example-if-else.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

<div class="alert-example">

The two parse trees in Figure 3.5 show the ambiguity of this sentential form.

Consider the following example of this construct:

```java
if (done == true)
if (denom == 0)
    quotient = 0;
    else quotient = num / denom;
```

The problem is that if the upper parse tree in Figure 3.5 is used as the basis for translation, the else clause would be executed when `done` is not true, which probably is not what was intended by the author of the construct.

![](./img/3.5.jpg ':figure Two distinct parse trees for the same sentential form.')

</div>

For this situation, statements must be distinguished between those that are matched and those that are unmatched, where unmatched statements are *else-less* `if`s and all other statements are matched.

Therefore, there cannot be an `if` statement without an `else` between a then clause and its matching `else`.

```java
if ()
  // then clause
  // if-else 中不包含 else-less if
  // 表示語言規定 else 會與離最近的 if 匹配
else
```

To reflect the different categories of statements, different abstractions, or nonterminals, must be used. The unambiguous grammar based on these ideas follows:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The Unambiguous Grammar}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <stmt> → <matched> | <unmatched>
\state <matched> → if (<logic\_expr>) <matched> else <matched>
\state $\hspace{6.25em}$ | any non-if statement
\state <unmatched> → if (<logic\_expr>) <stmt>
\state $\hspace{7.4em}$ | if (<logic\_expr>) <matched> else <unmatched>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

There is just one possible parse tree, using this grammar, for the following sentential form:

[](./embed/example-if-else.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

## Extended BNF

The extensions do not enhance the descriptive power of BNF; they only increase its readability and writability.

Three extensions are commonly included in the various versions of EBNF.

1. The first of these denotes an *optional part of an RHS*, which is delimited by brackets (`[]`).

<div class="alert-example">

A C `if-else` statement can be described as

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:EBNF -->

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{If Statement Rule}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <if\_stmt> → if (<expression>) <statement> [else <statement>]

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tab:Without Brackets -->

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{If Statement Rule}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <if\_stmt> → if (<expression>) <statement>
\state $\hspace{5.6em}$ | if (<expression>) <statement> else <statement>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

</div>

2. The second extension is the use of braces (`{}`) in a RHS to indicate that the enclosed part can be *repeated indefinitely* or *left out* altogether. This extension allows lists to be built with a single rule, *instead of using recursion* and two rules.

<div class="alert-example">

Lists of identifiers separated by commas can be described by the following rule:

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:EBNF -->

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Lists of Identifiers}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <ident\_list> → <identifier> \{, <identifier>\}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tab:Recursion -->

[](./embed/example-list-rule-recursion.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

<!-- tabs:end -->

This is a replacement of the recursion by a form of implied iteration; the part enclosed within braces can be iterated any number of times.

</div>

3. The third common extension deals with *multiple-choice options*. When a single element must be chosen from a group, the options are placed in parentheses (`()`) and separated by the OR operator, `|`.

<div class="alert-example">

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:EBNF -->

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Multiple-Choice Options}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <term> → <term> (* | / | \%) <factor>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tab:BNF -->

In BNF, a description of this `<term>` would require the following three rules:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Require Three Rules}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <term> → <term> * <factor>
\state $\hspace{4.5em}$ | <term> / <factor>
\state $\hspace{4.5em}$ | <term> % <factor>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

</div>

- The brackets, braces, and parentheses in the EBNF extensions are **metasymbols**, which means they are *notational tools* and not terminal symbols in the syntactic entities they help describe.
- In cases where these *metasymbols* are also *terminal symbols* in the language being described, the instances that are terminal symbols can be *underlined* or *quoted*.

### BNF vs. EBNF

BNF and EBNF Versions of an Expression Grammar

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:BNF Version -->

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{BNF Version}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <expr> → <expr> + <term>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <expr> - <term>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <term>
\state <term> → <term> * <factor>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <term> / <factor>
\state $\hspace{4.4em}$ | <factor>
\state <factor> → <exp> ** <factor>
\state $\hspace{5em}$ | <exp>
\state <exp> → (<expr>)
\state $\hspace{4em}$ | id

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tab:EBNF Version -->

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{EBNF Version}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <expr> → <term> \{(+ | $-$) <term>\}
\state <term> → <factor> \{(* | /) <factor>\}
\state <factor> → <exp> \{ ** <exp>\}
\state <exp> → (<expr>)
\state $\hspace{4em}$ | id

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

<div class="alert-example">

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{The BNF Rule}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <expr> → <expr> + <term>

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

clearly specifies the `+` operator to be *left associative*.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{However, The EBNF Version}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <expr> → <term> \{+ <term>\}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

does not imply the direction of associativity.

This problem is overcome in a syntax analyzer based on an EBNF grammar for expressions by designing the syntax analysis process to enforce the correct associativity. This is discussed further in Chapter 4.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

- Some versions of EBNF allow a *numeric superscript* to be attached to the right brace to indicate an upper limit to the number of times the enclosed part can be repeated.
- Also, some versions use a plus (`+`) superscript to indicate one or more *repetitions*.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Both Are Equivalent}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <compound> → begin <stmt> \{<stmt>\} end
\state <compound> → begin \{<stmt>\}$^+$ end

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

</div>

### Recent Variations in EBNF

In recent years, some variations on BNF and EBNF have appeared. Among
these are the following:

- In place of the arrow (`→`), a colon (`:`) is used and the RHS is placed on the next line.
- Instead of a vertical bar (`|`) to separate alternative RHSs, they are simply placed on separate lines.
- In place of square brackets (`[]`) to indicate something being optional, the subscript `opt` is used. For example,

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Indicate Something Being Optional}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state Constructor Declarator → SimpleName (FormalParameterList$_\text{opt}$)

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

- Rather than using the `|` symbol in a parenthesized list of elements to indicate a choice, the words “`one of`” are used. For example,

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Indicate Something Being Optional}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state AssignmentOperator → one of $\text{　=　*=　/=　\%=　+=　} -=\text{　<<=　>>=　\&=　\^ =　|=}$

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

There is a standard for EBNF, ISO/IEC 14977:1996 (1996), but it is rarely used.

## Grammars and Recognizers

There is a close relationship between generation and recognition devices for a given language.

?> In fact, given a context-free grammar, a recognizer for the language generated by the grammar can be algorithmically constructed.

- A number of software systems have been developed that perform this construction.
- Such systems allow the quick creation of the syntax analysis part of a compiler for a new language and are therefore quite valuable.

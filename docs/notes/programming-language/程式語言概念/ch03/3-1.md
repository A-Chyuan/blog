## Syntax

The **syntax** of a programming language is the *form* of its expressions, statements, and program units.

## Semantics

Its **semantics** is the *meaning* of those expressions, statements, and program units.

<div class="alert-example">

The *syntax* of a Java `while` statement is

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Syntax of Java while Statement}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state while (boolean\_expr) statement

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The *semantics* of this statement form is that when the current value of the Boolean expression is

- `true`, the embedded statement is executed. Then control implicitly returns to the Boolean expression to repeat the process.
- `false`, control transfers to the statement following the `while` construct.

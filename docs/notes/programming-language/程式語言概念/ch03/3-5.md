# Describing the Meanings of Programs: Dynamic Semantics

We now turn to the difficult task of describing the **dynamic semantics**:

- Expressions
- Statements
- Program units

?> For the remainder of this section, when we use the term *semantics*, we mean dynamic semantics.

<div class="alert-attention">

- Because of the power and naturalness of the available notation, describing syntax is a relatively simple matter.
- On the other hand, <mark>no universally accepted notation or approach has been devised for dynamic semantics.</mark>

</div>

<div class="alert-note">

In this section, we briefly describe several of the methods that have been developed.

1. **Operational semantics** depends on programming languages of lower levels, not mathematics.

    - The statements of one programming language are described in terms of the statements of a *lower-level programming language*.
    - This approach can lead to *circularities*, in which concepts are indirectly defined in terms of themselves.

2. **Denotational semantics** is the most rigorous and most widely known formal method for describing the meaning of programs.

    - It is solidly based on *recursive function* theory.

3. **Axiomatic semantics** is based on mathematical *logic*.

    - Rather than directly specifying the meaning of a program, axiomatic semantics specifies what can be proven about the program.

</div>

## Operational Semantics

The idea behind operational semantics is to <mark>describe the meaning of a statement or program by specifying the effects of running it on a machine.</mark>

There are different levels of uses of operational semantics.

- **Natural operational semantics**:

    At the highest level, the interest is in the final result of the execution of a complete program.

    If the semantics description is to be used for natural operational semantics, a virtual machine (an interpreter) must be constructed for the intermediate language.

    The virtual machine can be used to execute either single statements, code segments, or whole programs.

- **Structural operational semantics**:

    At the lowest level, operational semantics can be used to determine the precise meaning of a program through an examination of the complete sequence of state changes that occur when the program is executed.

    The semantics description can be used without a virtual machine if the meaning of a single statement is all that is required.

    In this use, which is structural operational semantics, the intermediate code can be visually inspected.

### The Basic Process

The first step in creating an operational semantics description of a language is to design an appropriate intermediate language, where

- The primary desired characteristic of the language is clarity.
- Every construct of the intermediate language must have an obvious and *unambiguous meaning*.
- This language is at the *intermediate level*, because machine language is too low-level to be easily understood and another high-level language is obviously not suitable.

In Chapter 8, the semantics of various control statements are described using this intermediate language.

<div class="alert-tip">

The intermediate language and its associated virtual machine used for formal operational semantics descriptions are often highly abstract.

- The intermediate language is meant to be convenient for the virtual machine, rather than for human readers.
- For our purposes, however, a more *human-oriented* intermediate language could be used.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

For example, the semantics of the C `for` construct can be described in terms of simpler statements, as in

```c
for (expr1; expr2; expr3) {
    …
}
```

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Meaning of For Statement in C}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $\hspace{3em}$ expr1;
\state loop: $\hspace{0.5em}$ \textbf{if} expr2 == 0 \textbf{goto} out
\state $\hspace{3em}$ …
\state $\hspace{3em}$ expr3;
\state $\hspace{3em}$ \textbf{goto} loop
\state out: $\hspace{0.9em}$ …

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The *human* reader of such a description is the *virtual computer* and is assumed to be able to “execute” the instructions in the definition correctly and recognize the effects of the “execution.”

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

As such an example, consider the following list of statements, which would be adequate for describing the semantics of the simple control statements of a typical programming language:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state ident = var
\state ident = ident + 1
\state ident = ident $-$ 1
\state \textbf{goto} label
\state \textbf{if} var relop var \textbf{goto} label

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

In these statements,

- `relop` is one of the relational operators from the set `{=, <>, >, <, <=, <=}`
- `ident` is an identifier
- `var` is either an identifier or a constant.

These statements are all simple and therefore easy to understand and implement.

A slight generalization of these three assignment statements allows more
general arithmetic expressions and assignment statements to be described. The
new statements are

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state ident = var bin\_op var
\state ident = un\_op var

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

- `bin_op` is a binary arithmetic operator.
- `un_op` is a unary operator.

Multiple arithmetic data types and automatic type conversions, of course, complicate this generalization. Adding just a few more relatively simple instructions would allow the semantics of arrays, records, pointers, and subprograms to be described.

</div>

## Denotational Semantics

The process of constructing a denotational semantics specification for a programming language requires:

- Defining a *mathematical object* for each language entity.
- Defining a *function* that *map*s instances of each language entity to instances of the corresponding mathematical object.

The difficulty with this method lies in creating the objects and the mapping functions. The method is named denotational because the mathematical objects denote the meaning of their corresponding syntactic entities.

The mapping functions of a denotational semantics programming language specification, like all functions in mathematics, have a domain and a range.

- The domain is the collection of values that are legitimate parameters to the function.

    The domain is called the **syntactic domain** because it is syntactic structures that are mapped.

- The range is the collection of objects to which the parameters are mapped.

    The range is called the **semantic domain**.

Denotational semantics is related to operational semantics.

- In operational semantics, programming language constructs are translated into simpler programming language constructs, which become the basis of the meaning of the construct.
- In denotational semantics, programming language constructs are mapped to mathematical objects, either sets or, more often, functions. However, unlike operational semantics, denotational semantics does not model the step-by-step computational processing of programs.

<div class="alert-example">

We use a very simple language construct, character string representations of binary numbers, to introduce the denotational method.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Syntax of Binary Number}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <bin\_num> → '0'
\state $\hspace{6.35em}$ | '1'
\state $\hspace{6.35em}$ | <bin\_num> '0'
\state $\hspace{6.35em}$ | <bin\_num> '1'

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

![](./img/3.9.jpg ':figure :size=40% A parse tree of the binary number 110.')

<div class="alert-attention">

Notice that we put apostrophes (`'`) around the syntactic digits to show they are not mathematical digits. This is similar to the relationship between ASCII coded digits and mathematical digits. When a program reads a number as a string, it must be converted to a mathematical number before it can be used as a value in the program.

</div>

- The *syntactic domain* of the mapping function for binary numbers is the set of all character string representations of binary numbers.
- The *semantic domain* is the set of nonnegative decimal numbers, symbolized by $N$.

The semantic function, named $M_\text{bin}$, maps the syntactic objects, as described in the previous grammar rules, to the objects in $N$, the set of non-negative decimal numbers.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Definition of Function $\textbf{M}_\textbf{bin}$}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $M_\text{bin}$ ('0') = 0
\state $M_\text{bin}$ ('1') = 1
\state $M_\text{bin}$ (<bin\_num> '0') = 2 * $M_\text{bin}$ (<bin\_num>)
\state $M_\text{bin}$ (<bin\_num>'1') = 2 * $M_\text{bin}$ (<bin\_num>) + 1

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The *meanings*, or denoted objects (which in this case are decimal numbers), can be attached to the nodes of the parse tree shown on the previous page, yielding the tree in Figure 3.10.

![](./img/3.10.jpg ':figure :size=40% A parse tree with denoted objects for 110.')

This is syntax-directed semantics. Syntactic entities are mapped to mathematical objects with concrete meaning.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

A similar example for describing the meaning of syntactic decimal literals. In this case,

- The *syntactic domain* is the set of character string representations of decimal numbers.
- The *semantic domain* is once again the set $N$.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Syntactic Domain}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <dec\_num> → '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
\state $\hspace{2em}$ | <dec\_num> ('0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9')

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The denotational mappings for these syntax rules are

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Definition of Function $\textbf{M}_\textbf{dec}$}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $M_\text{dec}$ ('0') = 0, $M_\text{dec}$ ('1') = 1, $M_\text{dec}$ ('2') = 2, …, $M_\text{dec}$ ('9') = 9
\state $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num> '0') = 10 * $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num>)
\state $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num> '1') = 10 * $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num>) + 1
\state …
\state $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num> '9') = 10 * $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num>) + 9

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

</div>

In the following sections, we present the denotational semantics descriptions of a few simple constructs. The most important simplifying assumption made here is that both the syntax and static semantics of the constructs are correct. In addition, we assume that only two scalar types are included: integer and Boolean.

### The State of a Program

The key difference between operational semantics and denotational semantics is:

- In *operational semantics*, state changes are defined by coded algorithms, written in some programming language.
- In *denotational semantics*, state changes are defined by mathematical functions.

Let the state $s$ of a program be represented as a set of ordered pairs, as follows:

$$
s = \{ <i_1, v_1>, <i_2, v_2>, \dots, <i_\text{n}, v_\text{n}> \}
$$

- Each $i$ is the name of a variable.
- The associated $v$’s are the current values of those variables.
- Any of the $v$’s can have the special value *undef*, which indicates that its associated variable is currently undefined.
- Let $\text{VARMAP}$ be a function of two parameters:
    - variable name
    - program state
- The value of $\text{VARMAP} (i_\text{j}, s)$ is $v_\text{j}$ (the value paired with $i_\text{j}$ in state $s$).

Most semantics mapping functions for programs and program constructs map states to states.

These state changes are used to define the meanings of programs and program constructs. Some language constructs—for example, expressions—are mapped to values, not states.

### Expressions

Expressions are fundamental to most programming languages.

<div class="alert-example">

We assume here that expressions have no side effects. Furthermore, we deal with only very simple expressions:

- The only operators are `+` and `*`.
- An expression can have at most one operator.
- The only operands are scalar integer variables and integer literals.
- There are no parentheses
- The value of an expression is an integer.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{BNF description of these expressions}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state <expr> → <dec\_num> | <var> | <binary\_expr>
\state <binary\_expr> → <left\_expr> <operator> <right\_expr>
\state <left\_expr> → <dec\_num> | <var>
\state <right\_expr> → <dec\_num> | <var>
\state <operator> → + | *

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The only error we consider in expressions is a variable having an undefined value. Obviously, other errors can occur, but most of them are machine-dependent.

Let

- $Z$ be the set of integers.
- $\text{error}$ be the error value.

Then $Z \cup \text{\{error\}}$ is the semantic domain for the denotational specification for our expressions.

The mapping function for a given expression $E$ and state $s$ follows.

- To distinguish between mathematical function definitions and the assignment statements of programming languages, we use the symbol $\Delta$= to define mathematical functions.
- The implication symbol, $\Rightarrow$, used in this definition connects the form of an operand with its associated case (or switch) construct.
- Dot (`.`) notation is used to refer to the child nodes of a node.
    - For example, `<binary_expr>.<left_expr>` refers to the left child node of `<binary_expr>`.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Mapping Function}
\begin{algorithmic}

\comment{根據 <expr> 的類型}
\state $M_\text{e}$(<expr>, s) $\Delta$= case <expr> of \\\\

\state $\hspace{2em}$ <dec\_num> $\Rightarrow$ $M_\text{dec}$ (<dec\_num>, s) \\\\

\state $\hspace{2em}$ <var> $\Rightarrow$
\state $\hspace{4em}$ if VARMAP (<var>, s) == \textbf{undef} then
\state $\hspace{6em}$ \textbf{error}
\state $\hspace{4em}$ else
\state $\hspace{6em}$ VARMAP(<var>, s) \\\\

\state $\hspace{2em}$ <binary\_expr> $\Rightarrow$
\state $\hspace{4em}$ if ($M_\text{e}$ (<binary\_expr>.<left\_expr>,s) == \textbf{undef} OR
\state $\hspace{5.3em}$ $M_\text{e}$ (<binary\_expr>.<right\_expr>, s) == \textbf{undef}) then
\state $\hspace{6em}$ \textbf{error}
\state $\hspace{4em}$ else if (<binary\_expr>.<operator> == '+') then
\state $\hspace{6em}$ $M_\text{e}$ (<binary\_expr>.<left\_expr>, s) +
\state $\hspace{6em}$ $M_\text{e}$ (<binary\_expr>.<right\_expr>, s)
\state $\hspace{4em}$ else
\state $\hspace{6em}$ $M_\text{e}$ (<binary\_expr>.<left\_expr>, s) *
\state $\hspace{6em}$ $M_\text{e}$ (<binary\_expr>.<right\_expr>, s)

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

</div>

### Assignment Statements

An assignment statement is an expression evaluation plus the setting of the target variable to the expression’s value.

In this case, the meaning function maps a state to a state.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Mapping Function}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $M_\text{a}$ (x = E, s) $\Delta$=
\state $\hspace{2em}$ if $M_\text{e}$ (E, s) == \textbf{error} then
\state $\hspace{4em}$ \textbf{error}
\state $\hspace{2em}$ else $s' = \{ <i_1, v_1'>, <i_2, v_2'>, \dots, <i_\text{n}, v_\text{n}'> \}$, where
\state $\hspace{4em}$ for j = 1, 2, $\dots$, n
\state $\hspace{6em}$ if $i_\text{j}$ == x then
\state $\hspace{8em}$ $v_\text{j}'$ = $M_\text{e}$ (E, s)
\state $\hspace{6em}$ else 
\state $\hspace{8em}$ $v_\text{j}'$ = VARMAP($i_\text{j}$, s)

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Note that the comparison in the third last line above, $i_\text{j} == x$, is of names, not
values.

### Logical Pretest Loops

The denotational semantics of a logical pretest loop is deceptively simple.

To expedite the discussion, we assume that there are two other existing mapping functions,

- $M_\text{sl}$ map statement lists and states to states.
- $M_\text{b}$ map Boolean expressions to Boolean values (or $\textbf{error}$).

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Mapping Function}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $M_1$ (while B do L, s) $\Delta$=
\state $\hspace{2em}$ if $M_\text{b}$ (B, s) == \textbf{undef} then
\state $\hspace{4em}$ \textbf{error}
\state $\hspace{2em}$ else if $M_\text{b}$ (B, s) == false then
\state $\hspace{4em}$ s
\state $\hspace{2em}$ else if $M_\text{sl}$ (L, s) == \textbf{error} then
\state $\hspace{4em}$ \textbf{error}
\state $\hspace{2em}$ else
\state $\hspace{4em}$ $M_1$ (while B do L, $M_\text{sl}$ (L, s))

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<div class="alert-attention">

In essence, the loop has been converted *from iteration to recursion*, where the recursion control is mathematically defined by other recursive state mapping functions.

?> Recursion is easier to describe with mathematical rigor than iteration.

</div>

## Axiomatic Semantics

In axiomatic semantics,

- there is no model of the state of a machine or program or model of state changes that take place when the program is executed.
- The meaning of a program is based on *relationships* among program variables and constants, which are the same for every execution of the program.

Axiomatic semantics has two distinct applications:

- Program verification (this section).
- Program semantics specification.

In a proof,

- Each statement of a program is both preceded and followed by a logical expression.
- The statement specifies constraints on program variables.
- These are used to specify the meaning of the statement.
- The notation used to describe constraints—indeed, the language of axiomatic semantics—is *predicate calculus*.
- Although simple Boolean expressions are often adequate to express constraints, in some cases they are not.

### Assertions

The *logical expressions* used in axiomatic semantics are called **predicates**, or **assertions**.

- **Precondition**:

    An assertion immediately preceding a program statement describes the constraints on the program variables at that point in the program.

- **Postcondition**:

    An assertion immediately following a statement describes the new constraints on those variables (and possibly others) after execution of the statement.

- For two adjacent statements, the postcondition of the first serves as the precondition of the second.

- Developing an axiomatic description or proof of a given program requires that every statement in the program has both a precondition and a postcondition.

?> In axiomatic semantics, the meaning of a specific statement is defined by its precondition and its postcondition. In effect, the two assertions specify precisely the effect of executing the statement.

<div class="alert-attention">

In the following sections

- We examine assertions from the point of view that *preconditions for statements are computed from given postconditions*, although it is possible to consider these in the opposite sense.
- We assume all variables are integer type.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

As a simple example, consider the following assignment statement and postcondition:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Assignment Statement and Postcondition}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state sum = 2 * x + 1 \{ sum > 1 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Precondition and postcondition assertions are presented in braces (`{}`) to distinguish them from parts of program statements.

One possible precondition for this statement is `{x > 10}`.

</div>

### Weakest Preconditions

The **weakest precondition** is the least restrictive precondition that will guarantee the validity of the associated postcondition.

<div class="alert-example">

In the previous example, the weakest of all preconditions is `{x > 0}`.

</div>

<div class="stepper">

Program Proof Process:

- The postcondition for the entire program is the desired result.
- Work back through the program to the first statement.
- If the precondition on the first statement is the same as the program specification, the program is correct.

</div>

***Inference Rule***

An **inference rule** is a method of inferring the truth of one assertion on the basis of the values of other assertions.

The general form of an inference rule is as follows:

$$
\dfrac{S_1, \ S_2, \ \dots, \ S_\text{n}}{S}
$$

This rule states that if $S_1, \ S_2, \ \dots, \text{and } S_\text{n}$ are true, then the truth of $S$ can be
inferred.

- The top part of an inference rule is called its **antecedent**.
- The bottom part is called its **consequent**.

***Axiom***

An **axiom** is a logical statement that is assumed to be *true*. Therefore, an axiom is an inference rule without an antecedent.

### Assignment Statements

The precondition and postcondition of an assignment statement together
define its meaning. To define the meaning of an assignment statement there
must be a way to compute its precondition from its postcondition.

Let

$x = E$ be a general assignment statement and $Q$ be its postcondition.

Then, its weakest precondition, $P$, is defined by the axiom

$$
P = Q_{x \rightarrow E}
$$

which means that $P$ is computed as $Q$ with all instances of $x$ replaced by $E$.

The usual notation for specifying the axiomatic semantics of a given statement form is

$$
\{ P \} \ S \ \{ Q \}
$$

where

- $P$ is the precondition.
- $Q$ is the postcondition.
- $S$ is the statement form.

In the case of the assignment statement, the notation is

$$
\{ Q_{x \rightarrow E} \} \ x = E \ \{ Q \}
$$

<div class="alert-attention">

Remember that the assignment axiom is guaranteed to be correct only in the absence of side effects. An assignment statement has a side effect if it changes some variable other than its target.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Assignment Statement and Postcondition}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state a = b / 2 $-$ 1 \{ a < 10 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

the weakest precondition is computed by substituting $b / 2 - 1$ for a in the postcondition $\{ a < 10 \}$, as follows:

$$
\begin{gather}
& b / 2 - 1 < 10 \\
& b < 22
\end{gather}
$$

Thus, the weakest precondition for the given assignment statement and postcondition is $\{ b < 22 \}$.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Note that the appearance of the left side of the assignment statement in its right side does not affect the process of computing the weakest precondition. For

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Assignment Statement and Postcondition}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state x = x + y $-$ 3 \{ x > 10 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

the weakest precondition is

$$
\begin{gather}
& x + y - 3 > 10 \\
& y > 13 - x
\end{gather}
$$

</div>

Recall that axiomatic semantics was developed to *prove* the correctness of programs.

- A given assignment statement with both a precondition and a postcondition can be considered a logical statement, or theorem.
- If the assignment axiom, when applied to the postcondition and the assignment statement, produces the given precondition, the theorem is proved.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Logical Statement}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \{ x > 3 \} x = x $-$ 3 \{ x > 0 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Using the assignment axiom on the statement and its postcondition produces $\{ x > 3 \}$, which is the given precondition. Therefore, we have proven the example logical statement.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Next, consider the following logical statement:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Logical Statement}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \{ x > 5 \} x = x $-$ 3 \{ x > 0 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

In this case,

- The given precondition, $\{ x > 5 \}$, is not the same as the assertion produced by the axiom.
- However, it is obvious that $\{ x > 5 \}$ implies $\{ x > 3 \}$.

<div class="alert-note">

To use this in a proof, an inference rule named the **rule of consequence** is needed. The form of the rule of consequence is

$$
\dfrac{
    \{ P \} \ S \ \{ Q \}, P' \implies P, Q \implies Q'
}{
    \{ P' \} \ S \ \{ Q' \}
}
$$

The $\implies$ symbol means “implies,” and $S$ can be any program statement.

The rule can be stated as follows:

- If the logical statement $\{ P \} \ S \ \{ Q \}$ is true, the assertion $P'$ implies the assertion $P$, and the assertion $Q$ implies the assertion $Q'$, then it can be inferred that $\{ P' \} \ S \ \{ Q' \}$.
- In other words, the rule of consequence says that a postcondition can always be weakened and a precondition can always be strengthened.

This is quite useful in program proofs.

</div>

If we let

- $P$ be $\{ x > 3 \}$
- $Q$ and $Q'$ be $\{ x > 0 \}$
- $P'$ be $\{ x > 5 \}$

We have

$$
\dfrac{
    \{ x > 3 \} \ x = x - 3 \ \{ x > 0 \}, \ (x > 5) \implies (x > 3), \ (x > 0) \implies (x > 0)
}{
    \{ x > 5 \} \ x = x - 3 \ \{ x > 0 \}
}
$$

The first term of the antecedent ($\{ x > 3 \} \ x = x - 3 \ \{ x > 0 \}$) was proven with the assignment axiom. The second and third terms are obvious. Therefore, by the rule of consequence, the consequent is true.

</div>

### Sequences

The weakest precondition for a sequence of statements cannot be described by an axiom, because the precondition depends on the particular kinds of statements in the sequence. In this case, the precondition can only be described with an inference rule.

Let $S1$ and $S2$ be adjacent program statements. If $S1$ and $S2$ have the following pre- and postconditions

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Adjacent Program Statements}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \{ P1 \} S1 \{ P2 \}
\state \{ P2 \} S2 \{ P3 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

the inference rule for such a two-statement sequence is

$$
\dfrac{
    \{ P1 \} \ S1 \ \{ P2 \}, \ \{ P2 \} \ S2 \ \{ P3 \}
}{
    \{ P1 \} \ S1, S2 \ \{ P3 \}
}
$$

So, for our example,

- $ \{ P1 \} \ S1; S2 \ \{ P3 \} $ describes the axiomatic semantics of the sequence $S1; \ S2$.
- The inference rule states that to get the sequence precondition, the precondition of the second statement is computed.
- This new assertion is then used as the postcondition of the first statement, which can then be used to compute the precondition of the first statement, which is also the precondition of the whole sequence.

If $S1$ and $S2$ are the assignment statements

- $x1 = E1$
- $x2 = E2$

then we have

$$
\begin{gather}
\{ P3_{x2 \rightarrow E2} \} \ x2 = E2 \ \{ P3 \} \\
\{ (P3_{x2 \rightarrow E2})_{x1 \rightarrow E1} \} \ x1 = E1 \ \{ P3_{x2 \rightarrow E2} \}
\end{gather}
$$

Therefore, the weakest precondition for the sequence $x1 = E1; \ x2 = E2$ with postcondition $P3$ is $\{ (P3_{x2 \rightarrow E2})_{x1 \rightarrow E1} \}$.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following sequence and postcondition:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sequence and Postcondition}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state y = 3 * x + 1;
\state x = y + 3;
\state \{ x < 10 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The precondition for the second assignment statement is

$$
y < 7
$$

which is used as the postcondition for the first statement. The precondition for
the first assignment statement can now be computed:

$$
\begin{gather}
3 * x + 1 < 7 \\
x < 2
\end{gather}
$$

So, $\{ x < 2 \}$ is the precondition of both the first statement and the two-statement sequence.

</div>

### Selection

We next consider the inference rule for selection statements, the general form of which is

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{General Form of Selection Statement}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \textbf{if} B \textbf{then} S1 \textbf{else} S2

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

We consider only selections that include else clauses. The inference rule is

$$
\dfrac{
    \{ B \text{ and } P \} \ S1 \ \{ Q \}, \ \{ (\text{not } B) \text{ and } P \} \ S2 \ \{ Q \}
}{
    \{ P \} \ \text{if B then S1 else S2} \ \{ Q \}
}
$$

This rule specifies that selection statements must be proven both when the Boolean control expression is true and when it is false.

- The first logical statement above the line represents the `then` clause.
- The second represents the `else` clause.

According to the inference rule, we need a precondition $P$ that can be used in the precondition of both the `then` and `else` clauses.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following example of the computation of the precondition using the selection inference rule.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Example of Selection Statement}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \textbf{if} x > 0 \textbf{then}
\state $\hspace{2em}$ y = y $-$ 1
\state \textbf{else}
\state $\hspace{2em}$ y = y + 1

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Suppose the postcondition, $Q$, for this selection statement is $\{ y > 0 \}$.

- We can use the axiom for assignment on the `then` clause

    $$
    y = y - 1 \ \{ y > 0 \}
    $$

    This produces $\{ y - 1 > 0 \}$ or $\{ y > 1 \}$.

    It can be used as the *$P$ part* of the precondition for the `then` clause.

- Now we apply the same axiom to the `else` clause

    $$
    y = y + 1 \ \{ y > 0 \}
    $$

    which produces the precondition $\{ y + 1 > 0 \}$ or $\{ y > -1 \}$.

- Because

    $$
    {y > 1} \implies {y > -1}
    $$

    The rule of consequence allows us to use $\{ y > 1 \}$ for the precondition of the whole selection statement.

### Logical Pretest Loops

Computing the weakest precondition for a `while` loop is inherently more difficult than for a sequence.

- The number of iterations can*not* always be *predetermined*.
- In a case where the number of iterations is *known*, the loop can be unrolled and treated *as* a *sequence*.

*Inductive method* can be used for some loops.

- The principal step in induction is finding an inductive hypothesis.
- The corresponding step in the axiomatic semantics of a `while` loop is finding an assertion called a **loop invariant**, which is crucial to finding the weakest precondition.

The inference rule for computing the precondition for a `while` loop is as
follows:

$$
\dfrac{
    \text{ {$I$ and $B$} $S$ {$I$} }
}{
    \text{ {$I$} while $B$ do $S$ end {$I$ and (not $B$)} }
}
$$

In this rule, $I$ is the loop invariant. This seems simple, but it is not. The complexity lies in finding an appropriate loop invariant.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Axiomatic Description of a While Loop}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \{ P \} \textbf{while} B \textbf{do} S \textbf{end} \{ Q \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The loop invariant must satisfy a number of requirements to be useful.

- First, the weakest precondition for the `while` loop must guarantee the truth of the loop invariant.
- In turn, the loop invariant must guarantee the truth of the postcondition upon loop termination.
- During execution of the loop, the truth of the loop invariant must be unaffected by the evaluation of the loop-controlling Boolean expression and the loop body statements. Hence, the name *invariant*.

These constraints move us from the inference rule to the axiomatic description.

Another complicating factor for `while` loops is the question of loop termination.

- A loop that does not terminate cannot be correct, and in fact computes nothing.
- $Q$ is the postcondition that holds immediately after loop exit.
- Precondition $P$ for the loop is one that guarantees $Q$ at loop exit and also guarantees that the loop terminates.

The complete axiomatic description of a `while` construct requires all of the following to be true, in which $I$ is the loop invariant:

[](./embed/while-loop-axiomatic-description.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

If a loop computes a sequence of numeric values, it may be possible to find a loop invariant using an approach that is used for determining the inductive hypothesis when *mathematical induction* is used to prove a statement about a mathematical sequence.

The relationship between the number of iterations and the precondition for the loop body is computed for a few cases, with the hope that a pattern emerges that will apply to the general case.

It is helpful to treat the process of producing a weakest precondition as a function, $\textbf{wp}$. In general

$$
\text{wp(statement, postcondition) = precondition}
$$

A $\textbf{wp}$ function is often called a **predicate transformer**, because it takes a predicate, or assertion, as a parameter and returns another predicate.

To find $I$, the loop postcondition $Q$ is used to compute preconditions for several different numbers of iterations of the loop body, starting with none.

<div class="alert-example">

?> If the loop body contains a *single* assignment statement, the axiom for assignment statements can be used to compute these cases.

Consider the example loop:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \textbf{while} y <> x \textbf{do} y = y + 1 \textbf{end} \{ y = x \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

<div class="alert-attention">

Remember that the equal (`=`) sign is being used for two different purposes here.

- In assertions, it means *mathematical equality*.
- Outside assertions, it means the *assignment operator*.

</div>

For zero iterations, the weakest precondition is, obviously,

$$
\text{{ y = x }}
$$

For one iteration, it is

$$
\text{
    wp(y = y + 1, { y = x }) = { y + 1 = x }, or { y = x $-$ 1 }
}
$$

For two iterations, it is

$$
\text{
    wp(y = y + 1, { y = x $-$ 1 }) = { y + 1 = x $-$ 1 }, or { y = x $-$ 2 }
}
$$

For three iterations, it is

$$
\text{
    wp(y = y + 1, { y = x $-$ 2 }) = { y + 1 = x $-$ 2 }, or { y = x $–$ 3 }
}
$$

It is now obvious that $\{ y < x \} $ will suffice for cases of one or more iterations. Combining this with $\{ y = x \}$ for the zero iterations case, we get $\{y \leq x \}$, which can be used for the *loop invariant*.

A precondition for the `while` statement can be determined from the loop invariant. In fact, $I$ can be used as the precondition, $P$.

We must ensure that our choice satisfies the four criteria for $I$ for our example loop.

[](./embed/while-loop-axiomatic-description.md ':include :type=code algorithm')

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:First -->

First, because $P = I, P \implies I$.

<!-- tab:Second -->

The second requirement is $\text{{ I and B } S { I }}$ must be true:

In our example, we have

$$
\text{{y $\leq$ x and y <> x} y = y + 1 {y $\leq$ x}}
$$

Applying the assignment axiom to

$$
\text{y = y + 1 {y $\leq$ x}}
$$

we get $\{ y + 1 \leq x \}$, which is equivalent to $\{ y < x \}$, which is implied by $\{ y \leq x \text{ and } y <> x\}$. So, the earlier statement is proven.

<!-- tab:Third -->

Next, we must have

$$
\text{{I and (not B)} $\implies$ Q}
$$

In our example, we have

$$
\begin{gather}
\text{{(y $\leq$ x) and not (y <> x)} $\implies$ {y = x}} \\
\text{{(y $\leq$ x) and (y = x)} $\implies$ {y = x}} \\
\text{{y = x} $\implies$ {y = x}}
\end{gather}
$$

So, this is obviously true.

<!-- tab:Forth -->

Next, loop termination must be considered. In this example, the question is whether the loop

$$
\text{{y $\leq$ x} } \textbf{while} \text{ y <> x } \textbf{do} \text{ y = y + 1 } \textbf{end} \text{ {y = x}}
$$

terminates.

Recalling that $x$ and $y$ are assumed to be integer variables, it is easy to see that this loop does terminate.

- The precondition guarantees that $y$ initially is not larger than $x$.
- The loop body increments $y$ with each iteration, until $y$ is equal to $x$.
- No matter how much smaller $y$ is than $x$ initially, it will eventually become equal to $x$.
- So the loop will terminate.

<!-- tabs:end -->

Because our choice of $I$ satisfies all four criteria, it is a satisfactory loop invariant and loop precondition.

<div class="alert-attention">

The previous process used to compute the invariant for a loop does not always produce an assertion that is the weakest precondition (although it does in the example).

</div>

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

As another example of finding a loop invariant using the approach used in mathematical induction, consider the following loop statement:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \textbf{while} s > 1 \textbf{do} s = s / 2 \textbf{end} \{ s = 1 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

As before, we use the assignment axiom to try to find a loop invariant and a precondition
for the loop.

For zero iterations, the weakest precondition is

$$
\text{\{ s = 1 \}}
$$

For one iteration, it is

$$
\text{wp(s = s / 2, {s = 1}) = {s / 2 = 1}, or {s = 2}}
$$

For two iterations, it is

$$
\text{wp(s = s / 2, {s = 2}) = {s / 2 = 2}, or {s = 4}}
$$

For three iterations, it is

$$
\text{wp(s = s / 2, {s = 4}) = {s / 2 = 4}, or {s = 8}}
$$

From these cases, we can see clearly that the invariant is

$$
\text{{s is a nonnegative power of 2}}
$$

- Once again, the computed $I$ can serve as $P$, and $I$ passes the four requirements.
- Unlike our earlier example of finding a loop precondition, this one clearly is not a weakest precondition.

Consider using the precondition $\text{{s > 1}}$. The logical statement

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \{ s > 1 \} \textbf{while} s > 1 \textbf{do} s = s / 2 \textbf{end} \{ s = 1 \}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

can easily be proven, and this precondition is significantly broader than the one computed earlier.

The loop and precondition are satisfied for any positive value for $s$, not just powers of 2, as the process indicates.

?> Because of the *rule of consequence*, using a precondition that is stronger than the weakest precondition does not invalidate a proof.

</div>

<div class="alert-attention">

Finding loop invariants is not always easy. It is helpful to understand the nature of these invariants.

- First, a loop invariant is a weakened version of the loop postcondition and also a precondition for the loop.

    - So, $I$ must be weak enough to be satisfied prior to the beginning of loop execution.
    - But when combined with the loop exit condition, it must be strong enough to force the truth of the postcondition.

- Because of the difficulty of proving loop termination, that requirement is often ignored.

    - If loop termination can be shown, the axiomatic description of the loop is called **total correctness**.
    - If the other conditions can be met but termination is not guaranteed, it is called **partial correctness**.

- In more complex loops, finding a suitable loop invariant, even for partial correctness, requires a good deal of ingenuity.

- Because computing the precondition for a `while` loop depends on finding a loop invariant, proving the correctness of programs with `while` loops using axiomatic semantics can be difficult.

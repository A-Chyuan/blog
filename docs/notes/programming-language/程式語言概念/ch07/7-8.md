# Mixed-Mode Assignment

Mixed-mode expressions were discussed in 7-4. Frequently, assignment statements also are mixed mode.

The design question is: Does the type of the expression have to be the same as the type of the variable being assigned, or can coercion be used in some cases of type mismatch?

<div class="alert-example">

C, C++, and Perl use coercion rules for mixed-mode assignment that are similar to those they use for mixed-mode expressions; that is, many of the possible type mixes are legal, with coercion freely applied.

In a clear departure from C++, Java and C# allow mixed-mode assignment only if the required coercion is *widening*.

- So, an `int` value can be assigned to a `float` variable, but not vice versa.
- Disallowing half of the possible mixed-mode assignments is a simple but effective way to increase the reliability of Java and C#, relative to C and C++.

Of course, in functional languages, where assignments are just used to name values, there is no such thing as a mixed-mode assignment.

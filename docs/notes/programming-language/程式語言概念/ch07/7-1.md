# Introduction

Expressions are the fundamental means of specifying computations in a programming language.

It is crucial for a programmer to understand both the syntax and semantics of expressions of the language he or she uses.

- A formal mechanism (BNF) for describing the syntax of expressions was introduced in Chapter 3.
- In this chapter, the *semantics of expressions* are discussed.

To understand expression evaluation, it is necessary to be familiar with the

- Orders of operator
- Operand evaluation

The operator evaluation order of expressions is dictated by the associativity and precedence rules of the language.

---

Other issues in expression semantics are

- Type mismatches
- Coercions
- Short-circuit evaluation

---

The essence of the imperative programming languages is the dominant role of assignment statements.

- The purpose of these statements is to cause the side effect of changing the values of variables, or the state, of the program.
- So an integral part of all imperative languages is the concept of variables whose values change during program execution.

Functional languages use variables of a different sort, such as the parameters of functions. These languages also have declaration statements that bind values to names. These declarations are similar to assignment statements, but do not have side effects.

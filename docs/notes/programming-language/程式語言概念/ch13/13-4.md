# Monitors

One solution to some of the problems of semaphores in a concurrent environment is to encapsulate shared data structures with their operations and hide their representations—that is, to make shared data structures abstract data types with some special restrictions.

This solution can provide competition synchronization without semaphores by transferring responsibility for synchronization to the run-time system.

## Competition Synchronization

One of the most important features of monitors is that <mark>shared data is resident in the monitor</mark> rather than in any of the client units.

- The programmer does not synchronize mutually exclusive access to shared data through the use of semaphores or other mechanisms.
- Because the <mark>access mechanisms are part of the monitor</mark>, implementation of a monitor can be made to guarantee synchronized access by allowing only one access at a time.
- Calls to monitor procedures are implicitly blocked and stored in a queue if the monitor is busy at the time of the call.

A figure depicting a program containing four tasks and a monitor that provides synchronized access to a concurrently shared buffer is shown in Figure 13.3.

![](./img/13.3.jpg ':figure A program using a monitor to control access to a shared buffer.')

In this figure, the interface to the monitor is shown as the two boxes labeled `insert` and `remove` (for the insertion and removal of data). The monitor appears exactly like an abstract data type—a data structure with limited access—which is what a monitor is.

## Cooperation Synchronization

Although mutually exclusive access to shared data is intrinsic with a monitor, <mark>cooperation between processes is still the task of the programmer.</mark>

- In particular, the programmer must guarantee that a shared buffer does not experience underflow or overflow.
- Different languages provide different ways of programming cooperation synchronization, all of which are related to semaphores.

## Evaluation

- Monitors are <mark>a better way to provide *competition* synchronization</mark> than are semaphores, primarily because of the problems of semaphores, as discussed in [Section 13-3][].
- The *cooperation* synchronization is still a problem with monitors, as will be clear when Ada and Java implementations of monitors are discussed in the following sections.

Semaphores and monitors are equally powerful at expressing concurrency control:

- Semaphores can be used to implement monitors.
- Monitors can be used to implement semaphores.

# Event Handling with Java

In addition to Web applications, non-Web Java applications can present GUIs to users. GUIs in Java applications are discussed in this section.

The initial version of Java provided a somewhat primitive form of support for GUI components. In version 1.2 of the language, released in late 1998, a new collection of components was added. These were collectively called Swing.

## Java Swing GUI Components

The Swing collection of classes and interfaces, defined in `javax.swing`, includes GUI components, or widgets. Because our interest here is event handling, not GUI components, we discuss only two kinds of widgets: text boxes and radio buttons.

***Text Box***

A text box is an object of class `JTextField`. The simplest `JTextField` constructor takes a single parameter, the length of the box in characters. For example,

```java
JTextField name = new JTextField(32);
```

The `JTextField` constructor can also take a literal string as an optional first parameter. This string parameter, when present, is displayed as the initial contents of the text box.

***Radio Button***

Radio buttons are special buttons that are placed in a button group container.

- A button group is an object of class `ButtonGroup`, whose constructor takes no parameters.
- In a radio button group, only one button can be pressed at a time. If any button in the group becomes pressed, the previously pressed button is implicitly unpressed.
- The `JRadioButton` constructor, used for creating radio buttons, takes two parameters: a label and the initial state of the radio button (`true` or `false`, for pressed and not pressed, respectively).
    - If one radio button in a group is initially set to pressed, the others in the group default to unpressed.
    - After the radio buttons are created, they are placed in their button group with the `add` method of the group object.

Consider the following example:

```java
ButtonGroup payment = new ButtonGroup();
JRadioButton box1 = new JRadioButton("Visa", true);
JRadioButton box2 = new JRadioButton("Master Charge");
JRadioButton box3 = new JRadioButton("Discover");
payment.add(box1);
payment.add(box2);
payment.add(box3);
```

***Frames (Main Windows)***

A `JFrame` object is a frame, which is displayed as a separate window.

The `JFrame` class defines the data and methods that are needed for frames. So, a class that uses a frame can be a subclass of `JFrame`.

A `JFrame` has several layers called **panes**.

- We are interested in just one of those layers, the content pane.
- Components of a GUI are placed in a `JPanel` object (a panel), which is used to organize and define the layout of the components.
- A frame is created and the panel containing the components is added to that frameâ€™s content pane.

Predefined graphic objects, such as GUI components, are placed directly in a panel. The following creates the panel object used in the following discussion of components:

```java
JPanel myPanel = new JPanel();
```

After the components have been created with constructors, they are placed in the panel with the `add` method, as in

```java
myPanel.add(button1);
```

## The Java Event Model

When a user interacts with a GUI component, for example by clicking a button, the component creates an event object and calls an event handler through an object called an event listener, passing the event object.

- GUI components are event generators.
- The event handler provides the associated actions.

In Java, events are connected to event handlers through **event listeners**.

***Listener Registration***

Event listeners are connected to event generators through event listener registration.

- Listener registration is done with a method of the class that implements the listener interface, as described later in this section.
- Only event listeners that are registered for a specific event are notified when that event occurs.

The listener method that receives the message implements an event handler. To make the event-handling methods conform to a standard protocol, an *interface* is used. An interface prescribes standard method protocols but does not provide implementations of those methods.

***Structure of Event Handling in Java***

A class that needs to implement an event handler must implement an interface for the listener for that handler.

- There are several classes of events and listener interfaces. One class of events is `ItemEvent`, which is associated with the event of clicking a checkbox or a radio button, or selecting a list item.
- The `ItemListener` interface includes the protocol of a method, `itemStateChanged`, which is the handler for `ItemEvent` events. So, to provide an action that is triggered by a radio button click, the interface `ItemListener` must be implemented, which requires a definition of the method, `itemStateChanged`.

---

As stated previously, the connection of a component to an event listener is made with a method of the class that implements the listener interface.

- For example, because `ItemEvent` is the class name of event objects created by user actions on radio buttons, the `addItemListener` method is used to register a listener for radio buttons.
- The listener for button events created in a panel could be implemented in the panel or a subclass of `JPanel`. So, for a radio button named `button1` in a panel named `myPanel` that implements the `ItemEvent` event handler for buttons, we would register the listener with the following statement:

    ```java
    button1.addItemListener(this);
    ```

---

Each event handler method receives an event parameter, which provides information about the event. Event classes have methods to access that information.

<div class="alert-example">

When called through a radio button, the `isSelected` method returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the button was on or off (pressed or not pressed), respectively.

</div>

---

All the event-related classes are in the `java.awt.event` package, so it is imported to any class that uses events.

## An Example

The following is an example application, `RadioB`, that illustrates the use of events and event handling.

This application constructs radio buttons that control the font style of the contents of a text field.

- It creates a `Font` object for each of four font styles.
- Each of these has a radio button to enable the user to select the font style.

The purpose of this example is to show how events raised by GUI components can be handled to change the output display of the program dynamically. Because of our narrow focus on event handling, some parts of this program are not explained here.

```java
/* RadioB.java
 *
 * An example to illustrate event handling with interactive
 * radio buttons that control the font style of a textfield
 */
package radiob;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;

public class RadioB extends JPanel implements ItemListener {
    private JTextField text;
    private Font plainFont, boldFont, italicFont, boldItalicFont;
    private JRadioButton plain, bold, italic, boldItalic;
    private ButtonGroup radioButtons;

    // The constructor method is where the display is initially built
    public RadioB() {
        // Create the test text string and set its font
        text = new JTextField("In what font style should I appear?", 25);
        text.setFont(plainFont);
        // Create radio buttons for the fonts
        // and add them to a new button group
        plain = new JRadioButton("Plain", true);
        bold = new JRadioButton("Bold");
        italic = new JRadioButton("Italic");
        boldItalic = new JRadioButton("Bold Italic");
        radioButtons = new ButtonGroup();
        radioButtons.add(plain);
        radioButtons.add(bold);
        radioButtons.add(italic);
        radioButtons.add(boldItalic);
        // Create a panel and put the text and the radio
        // buttons in it; then add the panel to the frame
        JPanel radioPanel = new JPanel();
        radioPanel.add(text);
        radioPanel.add(plain);
        radioPanel.add(bold);
        radioPanel.add(italic);
        radioPanel.add(boldItalic);
        add(radioPanel, BorderLayout.LINE_START);
        // Register the event handlers
        plain.addItemListener(this);
        bold.addItemListener(this);
        italic.addItemListener(this);
        boldItalic.addItemListener(this);
        // Create the fonts
        plainFont = new Font("Serif", Font.PLAIN, 16);
        boldFont = new Font("Serif", Font.BOLD, 16);
        italicFont = new Font("Serif", Font.ITALIC, 16);
        boldItalicFont = new Font("Serif", Font.BOLD + Font.ITALIC, 16);
    }

    // The event handler
    public void itemStateChanged (ItemEvent e) {
        // Determine which button is on and set the font accordingly
        if (plain.isSelected())
            text.setFont(plainFont);
        else if (bold.isSelected())
            text.setFont(boldFont);
        else if (italic.isSelected())
            text.setFont(italicFont);
        else if (boldItalic.isSelected())
            text.setFont(boldItalicFont);
    }

    // The main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the window frame
        JFrame myFrame = new JFrame(" Radio button example");
        // Create the content pane and set it to the frame
        JComponent myContentPane = new RadioB();
        myContentPane.setOpaque(true);
        myFrame.setContentPane(myContentPane);
        // Display the window.
        myFrame.pack();
        myFrame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

The RadioB.java application produces the screen shown in Figure 14.2.

# Event Handling in C#

Event handling in C# (and in the other .NET languages) is similar to that of Java.

.NET provides two approaches to creating GUIs in applications:

- The original Windows Forms.
- The more recent Windows Presentation Foundation.

The latter is the more sophisticated and complex of the two. Because our interest is just in event handling, we will use the simpler Windows Forms to discuss our subject.

***Windows Forms***

Using Windows Forms, a C# application that constructs a GUI is created by subclassing the `Form` predefined class, which is defined in the `System.Windows.Forms` namespace.

- This class implicitly provides a window to contain our components.
- There is no need to build frames or panels explicitly.

***Text and Radio Button***

Text can be placed in a `Label` object. The size of a `Label` object is not explicitly specified in the constructor; rather it can be specified by setting the `AutoSize` data member of the `Label` object to `true`, which sets the size according to what is placed in it.

Radio buttons are objects of the `RadioButton` class.

***Properties of Component***

Components can be placed at a particular location in the window by assigning a new `Point` object to the `Location` property of the component.

- The `Point` class is defined in the `System.Drawing` namespace.
- The `Point` constructor takes two parameters, which are the coordinates of the object in pixels. For example, `Point(100, 200)` is a position that is 100 pixels from the left edge of the window and 200 pixels from the top.

The label of a component is set by assigning a string literal to the `Text` property of the component.

After creating a component, it is added to the form window by sending it to the `Add` method of the `Controls` subclass of the form.

Therefore, the following code creates a radio button with the label `Plain` at the `(100, 300)` position in the output window:

```csharp
private RadioButton plain = new RadioButton();
plain.Location = new Point(100, 300);
plain.Text = "Plain";
Controls.Add(plain);
```

***Event Handler***

All C# event handlers have the same protocol:

- the return type is `void`.
- the two parameters are of types `object` and `EventArgs`. Neither of the parameters needs to be used for a simple situation.

An event handler method can have any name.

<div class="alert-example">

A radio button is tested to determine whether it is clicked with the Boolean `Checked` property of the button. Consider the following skeletal example of an event handler:

```csharp
private void rb_CheckedChanged (object o, EventArgs e){
    if (plain.Checked) ...
    ...
}
```

</div>

***Event Registration***

To register an event, a new `EventHandler` object must be created.

- The constructor for this class is sent the name of the *handler method*.
- The new object is added to the predefined delegate for the event on the component object (using the `+=` assignment operator).

<div class="alert-example">

When a radio button changes from unchecked to checked, the `CheckedChanged` event is raised and the handlers registered on the associated delegate, which is referenced by the name of the event, are called.

If the event handler is named `rb_CheckedChanged`, the following statement would register the handler for the `CheckedChanged` event on the radio button `plain`:

```csharp
plain.CheckedChanged += new EventHandler(rb_CheckedChanged);
```

</div>

## An Example

Following is the `RadioB` example from Section 14.6 rewritten in C#. Once again, because our focus is on event handling, we do not explain all of the details of the program.

```csharp
// RadioB.cs
// An example to illustrate event handling with
// interactive radio buttons that control the font
// style of a string of text
namespace RadioB {
    using System;
    using System.Drawing;
    using System.Windows.Forms;

    public class RadioB : Form {
        private Label text = new Label();
        private RadioButton plain = new RadioButton();
        private RadioButton bold = new RadioButton();
        private RadioButton italic = new RadioButton();
        private RadioButton boldItalic = new RadioButton();

        // Constructor for RadioB
        public RadioB() {
            // Initialize the attributes of the text and radio buttons
            text.AutoSize = true;
            text.Text = "In what font style should I appear?";
            plain.Location = new Point(220,0);
            plain.Text = "Plain";
            plain.Checked = true;
            bold.Location = new Point(350, 0);
            bold.Text = "Bold";
            italic.Location = new Point(480, 0);
            italic.Text = "Italics";
            boldItalic.Location = new Point(610, 0);
            boldItalic.Text = "Bold/Italics";
            // Add the text and the radio buttons to the form
            Controls.Add(text);
            Controls.Add(plain);
            Controls.Add(bold);
            Controls.Add(italic);
            Controls.Add(boldItalic);
            // Register the event handler for the radio buttons
            plain.CheckedChanged += new EventHandler(rb_CheckedChanged);
            bold.CheckedChanged += new EventHandler(rb_CheckedChanged);
            italic.CheckedChanged += new EventHandler(rb_CheckedChanged);
            boldItalic.CheckedChanged += new EventHandler(rb_CheckedChanged);
        }

        // The main method is where execution begins
        static void Main() {
            Application.EnableVisualStyles();
            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault (false);
            Application.Run(new RadioB());
        }

        // The event handler
        private void rb_CheckedChanged (object o, EventArgs e) {
            // Determine which button is on and set the font accordingly
            if (plain.Checked)
                text.Font = new Font( text.Font.Name,
                    text.Font.Size, FontStyle.Regular);
            if (bold.Checked)
                text.Font = new Font(text.Font.Name,
                    text.Font.Size, FontStyle.Bold);
            if (italic.Checked)
                text.Font = new Font(text.Font.Name,
                    text.Font.Size, FontStyle.Italic);
            if (boldItalic.Checked)
                text.Font = new Font(text.Font.Name,
                    text.Font.Size, FontStyle.Italic ^ FontStyle.Bold);
        }
    }
}
```

The output from this program is exactly like that shown in Figure 14.2.

# Primitive Data Types

Data types that are not defined in terms of other types are called **primitive data types**.

## Numeric Types

### Integer

#### Signed and Unsigned Integers

The hardware of many computers supports several sizes of integers.

- Java includes four *signed* integer sizes: `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`.

    A signed integer value is represented in a computer by a string of *bits*, with one of the bits (typically the *leftmost*) representing the sign.

- C++ and C#, include `unsigned` integer types, which are types for integer values without signs. Unsigned types are often used for binary data.

<div class="alert-example">

Most integer types are supported directly by the hardware.

One example of an integer type that is *not* supported directly by the hardware is the long integer type of Python (F# also provides such integers).

Values of this type can have *unlimited length*. Long integer values can be specified as literals, as in the following example:

```fsharp
243725839182756281923L
```

Integer arithmetic operations in Python that produce values too large to be represented with int type store them as long integer type values.

#### Sign-Magnitude Notation

A negative integer could be stored in *sign-magnitude* notation, in which

- The sign bit is set to indicate negative.
- The remainder of the bit string represents the absolute value of the number.

Sign-magnitude notation, however, does not lend itself to computer arithmetic.

#### One's Complement Notation

In *ones-complement* notation, the negative of an integer is stored as the logical complement of its absolute value.

- Ones-complement notation has the disadvantage that it has *two* representations of zero.
- See any book on assembly language programming for details of integer representations.

#### Two's Complement Notation

Most computers now use a notation called **twos complement** to store negative integers, which is convenient for addition and subtraction.

In twos-complement notation, the representation of a negative integer is formed by

- taking the logical complement of the positive version of the number
- and adding one.

### Floating-Point

**Floating-point** data types model real numbers, but the representations are only *approximations* for many real values.

<div class="alert-example">

Fundamental constants like $\pi$ or $e$ (the base for the natural logarithms)

- Can not be correctly represented in floating-point notation.
- Can not be precisely represented in any finite amount of computer memory.

</div>

On most computers, floating-point numbers are *stored in binary*, which exacerbates the problem.

<div class="alert-example">

Even the value 0.1 in decimal cannot be represented by a finite number of binary digits.

</div>

Another problem with floating-point types is the *loss of accuracy* through arithmetic operations. For more information on the problems of floating-point notation, see any book on numerical analysis.

Most languages include two floating-point types:

- The `float` type is the standard size, usually stored in four bytes of memory.
- The `double` type is provided for situations where larger fractional parts and/or a larger range of exponents is needed. Double-precision variables usually occupy twice as much storage as float variables and provide at least twice the number of bits of fraction.

#### IEEE 754

- Floating-point values are represented as fractions and exponents, a form that is borrowed from *scientific notation*.
- Most newer machines use the IEEE Floating-Point Standard 754 format.

The collection of values that can be represented by a floating-point type is
defined in terms of precision and range.

- Precision is the accuracy of the fractional part of a value, measured as the number of bits.
- Range is a combination of the range of fractions and, more important, the range of exponents.

Figure 6.1 shows the IEEE Floating-Point Standard 754 format for **single** and **double-precision representation**.

### Complex

- Complex values are represented as ordered pairs of floating-point values.
- Languages that support a complex type include operations for arithmetic on complex values.

<div class="alert-example">

In Python, the imaginary part of a complex literal is specified by following it with a `j` or `J`—for example,

```python
(7 + 3j)
```

</div>

### Decimal

For business applications (money)

- Essential to COBOL.
- C# offers a decimal data type.

**Decimal** data types store a fixed number of decimal digits, with the implied decimal point at a fixed position in the value.

#### Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)

Decimal types are stored very much like character strings, using binary codes for the decimal digits. These representations are called **binary coded decimal (BCD)**.

- In some cases, they are stored one digit per byte, but in others, they are packed two digits per byte.
- Either way, they take more storage than binary representations.

<div class="alert-example">

It takes at least four bits to code a decimal digit.

- Therefore, to store a six-digit coded decimal number requires 24 bits of memory.
- However, it takes only 20 bits to store the same number in binary.

</div>

***Advantages***

Decimal types have the advantage of being able to precisely store decimal values, at least those within a restricted range, which cannot be done with floating-point.

<div class="alert-example">

For example, the number 0.1 (in decimal) can be exactly represented in a decimal type, but not in a floating-point type.

</div>

***Disadvantages***

The disadvantages of decimal types are that

- The range of values is restricted because no exponents are allowed.
- Representation in memory is mildly wasteful.

## Boolean Types

**Boolean** types are perhaps the simplest of all types. Their range of values has only two elements: one for `true` and one for `false`.

A Boolean value could be represented by a single *bit*, but because a single bit of memory cannot be accessed efficiently on many machines, they are often stored in the smallest efficiently addressable cell of memory, typically a *byte*.

<div class="alert-example">

One popular exception is C89, in which numeric expressions are used as conditionals. In such expressions, all operands with *nonzero* values are considered `true`, and zero is considered `false`.

Although C99 and C++ have a Boolean type, they also allow numeric expressions to be used as if they were Boolean.

```c
int value = 5;
if (value) { // `5` 非零，視為 true
}
```

```c
#include <stdbool.h> // C99
bool flag = true;
```

This is not the case in the subsequent languages, Java and C#.

```java
int value = 5;
if (value != 0) { // 需要明確比較
}
```

</div>

## Character Types

- 8-bit code **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which uses the values 0 to 127 to code 128 different characters.

- ISO 8859-1 is another 8-bit character code, but it allows 256 different characters.

- The UCS-2 standard, a *16-bit* character set, is often called **Unicode** and includes characters from most of the world’s natural languages.

    - The first 128 characters of Unicode are identical to those of ASCII.
    - UCS-4 (UTF-32), a 32-bit Unicode character set, is described in the ISO/IEC 10646 Standard.

To provide the means of processing codings of single characters, most programming languages include a primitive type for them. However, Python supports single characters only as character strings of length 1.

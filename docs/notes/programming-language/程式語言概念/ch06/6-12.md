# Optional Types

There are situations in programming when there is a need to be able to indicate that a variable does not currently have a value.

- Some older languages use *zero* as a nonvalue for numeric variables. This approach has the disadvantage of not being able to distinguish between when the variable is supposed to have the zero value and when the zero indicates that it has no value.
- Some newer languages provide types that can have a normal value or a special value to indicate that their variables have no value. Variables that have this capability are called **optional types**.

C# has two categories of variables, value and reference types.

- Reference types, which are classes, are optional types by their nature. The null value indicates that a reference type has no value.
- Value types, which are all struct types, can be declared to be optional types, which allows them to have the value null.

A variable is declared to be an optional type by following its type name
with a question mark (`?`), as in

```csharp
int? x;
```

To determine whether a variable has a normal value, it can be tested against `null`, as in

```csharp
int? x;
...
if(x == null)
    Console.WriteLine("x has no value");
else
    Console.WriteLine("The value of x is: {0}", x);
```

</div>

Swiftâ€™s optional types are similar to those of C#, except that the nonvalue is named `nil`, instead of `null`.

The Swift version of the above code is:

```swift
var Int? x;
...
if x == nil
    print("x has no value")
else
    print("The value of x is: \(x)")
```

</div>

# Record Types

A **record** is an aggregate of data elements in which the individual elements are identified by names and accessed through offsets from the beginning of the structure.

<div class="alert-example">

There is frequently a need in programs to model a collection of data in which the individual elements are not of the same type or size.

A data type for information about a college student might use

- Name (character string)
- Student number (integer)
- Grade point average (floating-point)

</div>

- In C, C++, C#, and Swift,

    - records are supported with the `struct` data type.
    - In C++, structures are a minor variation on classes.
    - In C#, structs also are related to classes, but are quite different from them.
    - C# structs are stack-allocated value types, as opposed to class objects, which are heap-allocated reference types.
    - Structs in C++ and C# are normally used as encapsulation structures, rather than data structures.
    - They are further discussed in this capacity in Chapter 11.

- Structs are also included in ML and F#.

- In Python and Ruby, records can be implemented as hashes, which themselves can be elements of arrays.

***Difference Between Record and Heterogeneous Arrays***

It may appear that records and heterogeneous arrays are the same, but that is not the case.

- The elements of a heterogeneous array are all references to data objects that reside in scattered locations, often on the heap.
- The elements of a record are of potentially different sizes and reside in adjacent memory locations.

## Definitions of Records

The fundamental difference between a record and an array is that record elements, or **fields**, are not referenced by indices.

- The fields are named with identifiers.
- References to the fields are made using these identifiers.

Another difference between arrays and records is that records in some languages are allowed to include unions, which are discussed in Section 6.10.

<div class="alert-example">

The COBOL form of a record declaration, which is part of the data division of a COBOL program, is illustrated in the following example:

```cobol
01  EMPLOYEE-RECORD.
    02  EMPLOYEE-NAME.
        05  FIRST   PICTURE IS X(20).
        05  Middle  PICTURE IS X(10).
        05  LAST    PICTURE IS X(20).
    02  HOURLY-RATE PICTURE IS 99V99.
```

The `EMPLOYEE-RECORD` record consists of

- The `EMPLOYEE-NAME` record.
- The `HOURLY-RATE` field.

The numerals `01`, `02`, and `05` that begin the lines of the record declaration are **level numbers**, which indicate by their relative values the hierarchical structure of the record. Any line that is followed by a line with a higher-level number is itself a record.

The `PICTURE` clauses show the formats of the field storage locations, with

- `X(20)` specifying 20 alphanumeric characters.
- `99V99` specifying four decimal digits with the decimal point in the middle.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

In Java, records can be defined as data classes, with nested records defined as nested classes. Data members of such classes serve as the record fields.

</div>

## References to Record Fields

References to the individual fields of records are syntactically specified by several different methods, two of which name the desired field and its enclosing records.

<div class="alert-example">

COBOL field references have the form

```cobol
field_name OF record_name_1 OF ... OF record_name_n
```

where the first record named is the smallest or innermost record that contains the field. The next record name in the sequence is that of the record that contains the previous record, and so forth.

For example, the `Middle` field in the COBOL record example above can be referenced with

```cobol
Middle OF EMPLOYEE-NAME OF EMPLOYEE-RECORD
```

</div>

- A **fully qualified reference** to a record field is one in which all intermediate record names, from the largest enclosing record to the specific field, are named in the reference.

    In the COBOL example above the field reference is fully qualified.

- As an alternative to fully qualified references, COBOL allows **elliptical references** to record fields.

    In an elliptical reference, the field is named, but any or all of the enclosing record names can be omitted, as long as the resulting reference is unambiguous in the referencing environment.

  <div class="alert-example">

    - `FIRST`
    - `FIRST OF EMPLOYEE-NAME`
    - `FIRST OF EMPLOYEE-RECORD`

    are elliptical references to the employeeâ€™s first name in the COBOL record declared above.

  </div>

### Dot Notation

Most of the other languages use **dot notation** for field references, where the components of the reference are connected with periods (`.`).

<div class="alert-example">

Names in dot notation have the opposite order of COBOL references: They use the name of the largest enclosing record first and the field name last.

For example, if
`Middle` is a field in the `Employee_Name` record which is embedded in the
`Employee_Record` record, it would be referenced with the following:

```
Employee_Record.Employee_Name.Middle
```

</div>

## Implementation of Record Types

The fields of records are stored in adjacent memory locations.

- But because the sizes of the fields are not necessarily the same, the access method used for arrays is not used for records.
- Instead, the *offset address*, relative to the beginning of the record, is associated with each field. Field accesses are all handled using these offsets.

The compile-time descriptor for a record has the general form
shown in Figure 6.7. Run-time descriptors for records are unnecessary.

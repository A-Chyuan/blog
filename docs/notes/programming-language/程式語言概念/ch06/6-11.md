# Pointer and Reference Types

***Two categories of variables***

- **Reference types**: Pointers are used to reference other variable
- **Value types**: Scalar variables are used to store data.

Reference variables are closely related to pointers.

***Pointer Type***

A **pointer** type is one in which the variables have

- A range of values that consists of *memory addresses* and
- A special value, **nil**. The value nil is not a valid address and is used to indicate that a pointer cannot currently be used to reference a memory cell.

---

Pointers are designed for two distinct kinds of uses:

- Pointers provide some of the power of indirect addressing, which is frequently used in assembly language programming.
- Pointers provide a way to manage dynamic storage.

A pointer can be used to access a location in an area where storage is dynamically allocated called a **heap**.

---

Variables that are dynamically allocated from the heap are called **heap-dynamic variables**.

- They often do not have identifiers associated with them and thus can be referenced only by pointer or reference type variables.
- Variables without names are called **anonymous variables**.

## Pointer Operations

Languages that provide a pointer type usually include two fundamental pointer operations:

- Assignment
- Dereferencing

### Assignment

*Assignment* sets a pointer variable’s value to some useful address.

- If pointer variables are used only to manage dynamic storage, then the allocation mechanism, whether by operator or built-in subprogram, serves to initialize the pointer variable.

    ```c
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); // 使用 malloc 分配記憶體
    ```

- If pointers are used for indirect addressing to variables that are *not* heap dynamic, then there must be an explicit operator or built-in subprogram for fetching the address of a variable, which can then be assigned to the pointer variable.

    ```c
    int x = 42;
    int* ptr = &x; // 使用 '&' 取得變數 `x` 的位址
    ```

### Dereferencing

An occurrence of a pointer variable in an expression can be interpreted in two distinct ways.

- Normal pointer reference:

    It could be interpreted as a reference to the contents of the memory cell to which it is bound, which in the case of a pointer is an *address*.

    This is exactly how a nonpointer variable in an expression would be interpreted, although in that case its value likely would not be an address.

- The result of **dereferencing** the pointer:

    The pointer also could be interpreted as a reference to the value in the memory cell pointed to by the memory cell to which the pointer variable is bound.

    In this case, the pointer is interpreted as an *indirect reference*.

Dereferencing, which takes a reference through one level of indirection, is the second fundamental pointer operation.

Dereferencing of pointers can be either explicit or implicit. In many contemporary languages, it occurs only when explicitly specified.

<div class="alert-example">

In C++, it is explicitly specified with the asterisk (`*`) as a prefix unary operator.

Consider the following example of dereferencing:

- If `ptr` is a pointer variable with the value 7080.
- If the cell whose address is 7080 has the value 206.

```cpp
j = *ptr
```

sets `j` to 206.

![](./img/6.8.jpg ':figure :size=55% The assignment operation j = *ptr')

</div>

When pointers point to records, the syntax of the references to the fields of these records varies among languages.

<div class="alert-example">

In C and C++, there are two ways a pointer to a record can be used to reference a field in that record.

- If a pointer variable `p` points to a record with a field named `age`, `(*p).age` can be used to refer to that field.
- The operator `->`, when used between a pointer to a struct and a field of that struct, combines dereferencing and field reference. For example, the expression `p -> age` is equivalent to `(*p).age`.

</div>

Languages that provide pointers for the management of a heap must include an explicit allocation operation.

<div class="alert-example">

Allocation is sometimes specified with a subprogram, such as `malloc` in C.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

In languages that support object-oriented programming, allocation of heap objects is often specified with the `new` operator.

C++, which does not provide implicit deallocation, uses `delete` as its deallocation operator.

</div>

## Pointer Problems

The pointers use could lead to several kinds of programming errors.

- Java have replaced pointers completely with *reference types*, which, along with implicit deallocation, minimize the primary problems with pointers.
- A reference type is really only a pointer with *restricted operations*.

### Dangling Pointers

A **dangling pointer**, or **dangling reference**, is a pointer that contains the address of a heap-dynamic variable that has been deallocated.

Notice that the *explicit deallocation* of dynamic variables is the cause of dangling pointers.

Dangling pointers are dangerous for several reasons.

- First, the location being pointed to may have been reallocated to some new heap-dynamic variable.
    - If the new variable is not the same type as the old one, type checks of uses of the dangling pointer are invalid.
    - Even if the new dynamic variable is the same type, its new value will have no relationship to the old pointer’s dereferenced value.
- Furthermore, if the dangling pointer is used to change the heap-dynamic variable, the value of the new heap-dynamic variable will be destroyed.
- Finally, it is possible that the location now is being temporarily used by the storage management system, possibly as a pointer in a chain of available blocks of storage, thereby allowing a change to the location to cause the storage manager to fail.

<div class="alert-example">

The following sequence of operations creates a dangling pointer in many languages:

1. A new heap-dynamic variable is created and pointer `p1` is set to point
to it.
2. Pointer `p2` is assigned `p1`’s value.
3. The heap-dynamic variable pointed to by `p1` is explicitly deallocated (possibly setting `p1` to *nil*), but `p2` is not changed by the operation. `p2` is now a dangling pointer. If the deallocation operation did not change `p1`, both `p1` and `p2` would be dangling. (Of course, this is a problem of aliasing—`p1` and `p2` are aliases.)

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

For example, in C++ we could have the following:

```cpp
int * arrayPtr1;
int * arrayPtr2 = new int[100];
arrayPtr1 = arrayPtr2;
delete [] arrayPtr2;
// Now, `arrayPtr1` is dangling, because the heap storage
// to which it was pointing has been deallocated.
```

In C++, both `arrayPtr1` and `arrayPtr2` are now dangling pointers, because the C++ `delete` operator has no effect on the value of its operand pointer.

In C++, it is common (and safe) to follow a `delete` operator with an assignment of zero, which represents null, to the pointer whose pointed-to value has been deallocated.

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10); // initializes it to 10
delete ptr;             // Deallocate memory
ptr = nullptr;          // Prevent dangling pointer (c++11)
```

</div>

### Lost Heap-Dynamic Variables

A **lost heap-dynamic variable** is an allocated heap-dynamic variable that is no longer accessible to the user program. Such variables are often called **garbage**, because they are not useful for their original purpose, and they also cannot be reallocated for some new use in the program.

<div class="alert-example">

Lost heap-dynamic variables are most often created by the following sequence of operations:

1. Pointer `p1` is set to point to a newly created heap-dynamic variable.
2. `p1` is later set to point to another newly created heap-dynamic variable.

The first heap-dynamic variable is now inaccessible, or lost.

This is sometimes called **memory leakage**. Memory leakage is a problem, regardless of whether the language uses implicit or explicit deallocation.

</div>

In the following sections, we investigate how language designers have dealt with the problems of dangling pointers and lost heap-dynamic variables.

## Pointers in C and C++

In C and C++, pointers can be used in the same ways as addresses are used in assembly languages.

- This means they are extremely flexible but must be used *with great care*.
- This design offers *no* solutions to the dangling pointer or lost heap-dynamic variable problems.
- However, the fact that *pointer arithmetic* is possible in C and C++ makes their pointers more interesting than those of the other programming languages.

C and C++ pointers can point at any variable, regardless of where it is allocated. In fact, they can point *anywhere* in memory, whether there is a variable there or not, which is one of the dangers of such pointers.

In C and C++,

<div class="alert-example">

- The asterisk (`*`) denotes the dereferencing operation.
- The ampersand (`&`) denotes the operator for producing the address of a variable.

Consider the following code:

```c
int *ptr;
int count, init;
...
ptr = &init;
count = *ptr;
```

- The assignment to the variable `ptr` sets it to the address of `init`.
- The assignment to `count` dereferences `ptr` to produce the value at `init`, which is then assigned to `count`.
- So, the effect of the two assignment statements is to assign the value of `init` to `count`.

Notice that the declaration of a pointer specifies its domain type.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Pointers can be assigned the address value of any variable of the correct domain type, or they can be assigned the constant zero, which is used for *nil*.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

*Pointer arithmetic* is also possible in some restricted forms.

If `ptr` is a pointer variable that is declared to point at some variable of some data type, then

```c
ptr + index
```

is a legal expression.

The semantics of such an expression is as follows.

- Instead of simply adding the value of `index` to `ptr`, the value of `index` is first *scaled* by the size of the memory cell (in memory units) to which `ptr` is pointing (its base type).

    For example, if `ptr` points to a memory cell for a type that is four memory units in size, then index is multiplied by 4, and the result is added to `ptr`.

- The primary purpose of this sort of address arithmetic is *array manipulation*.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

- All arrays use zero as the lower bound of their subscript ranges.
- *Array names* without subscripts always refer to the address of the first element.

Consider the following declarations:

```c
int list[10];
int *ptr;
```

Now consider the assignment

```c
ptr = list;
```

This assigns the address of `list[0]` to `ptr`. Given this assignment, the following are true:

- `*(ptr + 1)` is equivalent to `list[1]`.
- `*(ptr + index)` is equivalent to `list[index]`.
- `ptr[index]` is equivalent to `list[index]`.

It is clear from these statements that the pointer operations include the same scaling that is used in indexing operations. Furthermore, pointers to arrays can be indexed as if they were array names.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Pointers in C and C++ can point to *functions*.

?> This feature is used to pass functions as parameters to other functions.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Pointers are also used for parameter passing, as discussed in Chapter 9.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

C and C++ include pointers of type `void *`, which can point at values of any type.

- In effect they are generic pointers.
- However, type checking is not a problem with `void *` pointers, because these languages *disallow* dereferencing them.
- One common use of `void *` pointers is as the types of parameters of functions that operate on memory.

For example, suppose we wanted a function to move a sequence of bytes of data from one place in memory to another.

```c
#include <stddef.h> // for size_t

void memory_move(void *dest, const void *src, size_t num_bytes) {
    // 將 void * 轉型為 char *，以便逐位元組操作
    char *d = (char *)dest;
    const char *s = (const char *)src;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_bytes; i++) {
        d[i] = s[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int src_data[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    int dest_data[3] = {0}; // 初始化為 0

    // 使用 memory_move 複製資料
    memory_move(dest_data, src_data, sizeof(src_data));

    return 0;
}
```

- It would be most general if it could be passed two pointers of any type. This would be legal if the corresponding formal parameters in the function were `void *` type.
- The function could then convert them to `char *` type and do the operation, regardless of what type pointers were sent as actual parameters.

## Reference Types

A **reference type** variable is similar to a pointer, with one important and fundamental difference:

- Pointer refers to an *address* in memory. It is natural to perform arithmetic on addresses.
- Reference refers to an object or a *value* in memory. It is not sensible to do arithmetic on references.

<div class="alert-example">

C++ includes a special kind of reference type that is used primarily for the formal parameters in function definitions.

A C++ reference type variable is a *constant* pointer that is always implicitly dereferenced.

- It must be initialized with the address of some variable in its definition
- After initialization a reference type variable can never be set to reference any other variable.
- The implicit dereference prevents assignment to the address value of a reference variable.

Reference type variables are specified in definitions by preceding their
names with ampersands (`&`). For example,

```cpp
int result = 0;
int &ref_result = result;
...
ref_result = 100;
```

In this code segment, `result` and `ref_result` are aliases.

When used as *formal parameters* in function definitions,

- C++ reference types provide for *two-way communication* between the caller function and the called function.

    Passing a pointer as a parameter accomplishes the same two-way communication, but pointer formal parameters require *explicit dereferencing*, making the code less readable and less safe.

- This is not possible with *nonpointer* primitive parameter types, because C++ parameters are *passed by value*.

Reference parameters are referenced in the called function exactly as are other parameters.

- The calling function need not specify that a parameter whose corresponding formal parameter is a reference type is anything unusual.
- The compiler passes addresses, rather than values, to reference parameters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Pass by reference
void updateValue(int &ref) {
    ref = 100;
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    cout << "Before: " << a << endl;
    
    updateValue(a);
    cout << "After: " << a << endl; // `a` 為 100
    
    return 0;
}
```

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

In their quest for increased safety over C++, the designers of Java removed C++-style pointers altogether.

Unlike C++ reference variables,

?> Java reference variables can be assigned to refer to different class instances; they are not constants.

All Java class instances are referenced by reference variables. That is, in fact, the only use of reference variables in Java. These issues are discussed further in Chapter 12.

In the following, `String` is a standard Java class:

```java
String str1;
...
str1 = "This is a Java literal string";
```

In this code, `str1` is defined to be a reference to a `String` class instance or object.

- It is initially set to null.
- The subsequent assignment sets `str1` to reference the `String` object, `"This is a Java literal string"`.

Because Java class instances are implicitly deallocated (there is no explicit
deallocation operator), there cannot be dangling references in Java.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

C# includes both the references of Java and the pointers of C++.

- Pointers were included in C# primarily to allow C# programs to interoperate with C and C++ code.
- However, the use of pointers is strongly discouraged.
- In fact, any subprogram that uses pointers must include the `unsafe` modifier.

Note that although objects pointed to by references are implicitly deallocated, that is not true for objects pointed to by pointers.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

All variables in the object-oriented languages Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby are references. They are always implicitly dereferenced. Furthermore, the direct values of these variables cannot be accessed.

</div>

## Evaluation

Pointers have been compared with the goto.

- The goto statement widens the range of statements that can be executed next.
- Pointer variables widen the range of memory cells that can be referenced by a variable.

On the other hand, pointers are necessary, for example, to write device drivers, in which specific absolute addresses must be accessed.

The references of Java and C# provide some of the flexibility and the capabilities of pointers, without the hazards.

## Implementation of Pointer and Reference Types

In most languages, pointers are used in heap management. The same is true for Java and C# references, as well as the variables in Smalltalk and Ruby, so we cannot treat pointers and references separately.

### Representations of Pointers and References

In most larger computers, pointers and references are single values stored in memory cells.

However, in *early* microcomputers based on Intel microprocessors,

- Addresses have two parts: a segment an offset.
- So, pointers and references are implemented in these systems as pairs of 16-bit cells, one for each of the two parts of an address.

### Solutions to the Dangling-Pointer Problem

There have been several proposed solutions to the dangling-pointer problem.

#### Tombstones

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Structure }
\begin{algorithmic}

\state pointer variable $\rightarrow$ tombstone $\rightarrow$ heap-dynamic variables (target)

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Every heap-dynamic variable includes a special cell, called a **tombstone**, that is itself a pointer to the heap-dynamic variable.

- The actual pointer variable points only at tombstones and never to heap-dynamic variables.
- When a heap-dynamic variable is deallocated, the tombstone remains but is set to nil, indicating that the heap-dynamic variable no longer exists.

This approach prevents a pointer from ever pointing to a deallocated variable. Any reference to any pointer that points to a *nil* tombstone can be detected as an error.

---

No widely used language uses tombstones. Tombstones are *costly* in both time and space.

- Because tombstones are never deallocated, their storage is never reclaimed.
- Every access to a heap-dynamic variable through a tombstone requires one more level of indirection, which requires an additional machine cycle on most computers.

#### Locks-and-Keys

An alternative to tombstones is the **locks-and-keys approach**.

In this compiler, pointer values are represented as ordered pairs (key, address).

- The key is an integer value.
- Heap-dynamic variables are represented as the storage for the variable plus a header cell that stores an integer lock value.

<div class="alert-example">

In the implementation of UW-Pascal:

- When a heap-dynamic variable is allocated, a lock value is created and placed both in the lock cell of the heap-dynamic variable and in the key cell of the pointer that is specified in the call to `new`.
- Every access to the dereferenced pointer compares the key value of the pointer to the lock value in the heap-dynamic variable. If they match, the access is legal; otherwise the access is treated as a run-time error.
- Any copies of the pointer value to other pointers must copy the key value. Therefore, any number of pointers can reference a given heap-dynamic variable.
- When a heap-dynamic variable is deallocated with `dispose`, its lock value is cleared to an illegal lock value. Then, if a pointer other than the one specified in the `dispose` is dereferenced, its address value will still be intact, but its key value will no longer match the lock, so the access will not be allowed.

</div>

#### Heap Management

Heap management can be a very complex run-time process. We examine the process in two separate situations:

- One in which all heap storage is allocated and deallocated in units of a single size.
- One in which variable-size segments are allocated and deallocated.

Note that for deallocation, we discuss only *implicit* approaches.

##### Single-Size Cells

***Characteristics***

- All allocation and deallocation is of single-size cells.
- Every cell already contains a pointer.

***Implementation Details of Memory Management***

Allocation:

- All available cells are linked together using the pointers in the cells, forming a list of available space.
- Allocation is a simple matter of taking the required number of cells from this list when they are needed.

Deallocation is a much more complex process:

- A heap-dynamic variable can be pointed to by more than one pointer, making it difficult to determine when the variable is no longer useful to the program.
- Simply because one pointer is disconnected from a cell obviously does not make it garbage; there could be several other pointers still pointing to the cell.

##### Garbage Collection

There are several different approaches to garbage collection. The two most common traditional techniques are in some ways opposite processes.

- **Reference counters**, *eager* approach.
- **Mark-sweep**, *lazy* approach.

###### Reference Counters

***Basic Concepts***

The reference counter method of storage reclamation accomplishes its goal by maintaining in every cell (memory) a counter that <mark>stores the number of pointers that are currently pointing at the cell.</mark>

- Embedded in the decrement operation for the reference counters, which occurs when a pointer is disconnected from the cell, is a check for a zero value.
- If the reference counter reaches *zero*, it means that no program pointers are pointing at the cell, and it has thus become garbage and can be returned to the list of available space.

***Three distinct problems***

- First, if storage cells are relatively small, the space required for the counters is significant.

- Second, some execution time is obviously required to maintain the counter values.

    Every time a pointer value is changed, the cell to which it was pointing must have its counter decremented, and the cell to which it is now pointing must have its counter incremented.

    In a language like Lisp, in which nearly every action involves changing pointers, that can be a significant portion of the total execution time of a program.

    Some of the inefficiency of reference counters can be eliminated by an approach named **deferred reference counting**, which avoids reference counters for some pointers.

- The third problem is that complications arise when a collection of cells is connected *circularly*.

    The problem here is that each cell in the circular list has a reference counter value of at least 1, which prevents it from being collected and placed back on the list of available space.

***Advantage***

- It is intrinsically incremental.

  ?> 漸進性。隨著程式執行逐步進行記憶體回收（即時回收），而非等到垃圾累積到一定程度後才啟動。

- Its actions are interleaved with those of the application, so it never
causes significant delays in the execution of the application.

###### Mark-Sweep

***Basic Concepts***

The mark-sweep process consists of three distinct phases.

- First, *all* cells in the heap have their indicators set to indicate they are *garbage*. This is, of course, a correct assumption for only some of the cells.
- Second, **marking** phase, is the most difficult. Every pointer in the program is traced into the heap, and all *reachable* cells are marked as not being garbage.
- Third, **sweep** phase, is executed: All cells in the heap that have not been specifically marked as still being used are returned to the list of available space.

***Simple Version of a Marking Algorithm***

```c
for every pointer r do {
    mark(r)
}

void mark(void * ptr) {
    if (ptr != 0) {
        if (*ptr.marker is not marked) {
            set *ptr.marker
            mark(*ptr.lLink)
            mark(*ptr.rLink)
        }
    }
}
```

![](./img/6.9.jpg ':figure :size=80% An example of the actions of the marking algorithm')

***Problems***

- 遞迴需要額外的堆疊空間。
- 每次回收需要掃描整個 heap，對大型應用來說代價很高。

##### Variable-Size Cells

Variable-size cells are required by most programming languages.

Managing a heap from which variable-size cells are allocated has all the difficulties of managing one for single-size cells, but also has additional problems.

The additional problems posed by variable-size cell management depend on the method used.

***Problems in Mark-Sweep***

- The initial setting of the indicators of all cells in the heap to indicate that they are garbage is difficult. Because the cells are different sizes, scanning them is a problem.

    One solution is to require each cell to have the cell size as its first field. Then the scanning can be done, although it takes slightly more space and somewhat more time than its counterpart for fixed-size cells.

- The marking process is nontrivial.

    How can a chain be followed from a pointer if there is no predefined location for the pointer in the pointed-to cell? Cells that do not contain pointers at all are also a problem.

    Adding an internal pointer to each cell, which is maintained in the background by the run-time system, will work. However, this background maintenance processing adds both space and execution time overhead to the cost of running the program.

- Maintaining the list of available space is another source of overhead.

    The list can begin with a single cell consisting of all available space. Requests for segments simply reduce the size of this block. Reclaimed cells are added to the list.

    The problem is that before long, the list becomes a long list of various-size segments, or blocks.

    This slows allocation because requests cause the list to be searched for sufficiently large blocks. Eventually, the list may consist of a large number of very small blocks, which are not large enough for most requests.

    At this point, adjacent blocks may need to be collapsed into larger blocks. Alternatives to using the first sufficiently large block on the list can shorten the search but require the list to be ordered by block size. In either case, maintaining the list is additional overhead.

***Problems in Reference Counters***

If reference counters are used, the first two problems are avoided, but the available-space list-maintenance problem remains.

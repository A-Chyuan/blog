# Array Types

An **array** is a *homogeneous* aggregate of data elements.

- An individual element is identified by its position in the aggregate, relative to the first element.
- The individual data elements of an array are of the same type.

References to individual array elements are specified using subscript expressions.

- If any of the subscript expressions in a reference include variables, then the reference will require an additional run-time calculation to determine the address of the memory location being referenced.

## Arrays and Indices

Specific elements of an array are referenced by means of a two-level syntactic mechanism, where the

- First part is the *aggregate name*,
- Second part is a possibly dynamic selector consisting of one or more items known as **subscripts** or **indices**.

***Finite Mappings***

Arrays are sometimes called **finite mappings**.

- If all of the subscripts in a reference are constants, the selector is static; otherwise, it is dynamic.
- The selection operation can be thought of as a mapping from the array name and the set of subscript values to an element in the aggregate.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Finite Mappings}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state array\_name(subscript\_value\_list) $\rightarrow$ element

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The syntax of array references is fairly universal: The array name is followed by the list of subscripts, which is surrounded by either parentheses (`()`) or brackets (`[]`).

- Most languages other than Fortran and Ada use brackets to delimit their array indices.

- In some languages that provide multidimensioned arrays as arrays of arrays, each subscript appears in its own brackets.

- A problem with using *parentheses* to enclose subscript expressions is that they often are also used to enclose the parameters in *subprogram calls*; this use makes references to arrays appear exactly like those calls.

  <div class="alert-example">

    For example, consider the following Ada assignment statement:

    ```ada
    Sum := Sum + B(I);
    ```

    Because parentheses are used for both subprogram parameters and array subscripts in Ada, both program readers and compilers are forced to use other information to determine whether `B(I)` in this assignment is a function call or a reference to an array element.

    This results in reduced readability.

    They made this choice in part because both array element references and function calls are mappings.

    - Array element references map the subscripts to a particular element of the array.
    - Function calls map the actual parameters to the function definition and, eventually, a functional value.

  </div>

***Element and Subscript Types***

Two distinct types are involved in an array type:

- The element type.
- The type of the subscripts (often integer).

***Subscript Range Checking***

Early programming languages did not specify that subscript ranges must be implicitly checked.

- Range errors in subscripts are common in programs, so requiring range checking is an important factor in the reliability of languages.
- Many contemporary languages also do not specify range checking of subscripts, but Java, ML, and C# do.

***Arrays in Perl***

<div class="alert-example">

Subscripting in Perl is a bit *unusual*.

- The names of all arrays begin with at signs (`@`).
- Array elements are always scalars and the names of scalars always begin with dollar signs (`$`).
- References to array elements use dollar signs rather than at signs in their names.

For example, for the array `@list`, the second element is referenced with `$list[1]`.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

One can reference an array element in Perl with a *negative* subscript, in
which case the subscript value is an offset from the end of the array.

For example, if the array `@list` has five elements with the subscripts 0..4, `$list[-2]` references the element with the subscript 3.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

A reference to a nonexistent element in Perl yields `undef`, but no error is reported.

</div>

## Subscript Bindings and Array Categories

The binding of the subscript type to an array variable is usually static, but the subscript value ranges are sometimes dynamically bound.

In some languages, the lower bound of the subscript range is implicit.

<div class="alert-example">

- In the C-based languages, the lower bound of all subscript ranges is fixed at 0.
- In some other languages, the lower bounds of the subscript ranges must be specified by the programmer.

</div>

***Four Categories of Arrays***

There are four categories of arrays, based on

- The binding to subscript ranges.

    Once the subscript ranges are bound and the storage is allocated, they remain fixed for the lifetime of the     variable. Of course, when the subscript ranges are fixed, the array cannot change size.

- The binding to storage.
- From where the storage is allocated.

### Static Array

A **static array** is one in which the subscript ranges are statically bound and storage allocation is static (done before run time).

- The advantage of static arrays is efficiency: No dynamic allocation or deallocation is required.
- The disadvantage is that the storage for the array is fixed for the entire execution time of the program.

<div class="alert-example">

Arrays declared in C and C++ functions that include the `static` modifier are static.

</div>

### Fixed Stack-Dynamic Array

A **fixed stack-dynamic array** is one in which the subscript ranges are statically bound, but the allocation is done at declaration elaboration time during execution.

- The advantage of fixed stack-dynamic arrays over static arrays is *space efficiency*.

    - A large array in one subprogram can use the same space as a large array in a different subprogram, as long as both subprograms are not active at the same time.
    - The same is true if the two arrays are in different blocks that are not active at the same time.
- The disadvantage is the required allocation and deallocation time.

<div class="alert-example">

Arrays that are declared in C and C++ functions without the `static` specifier are examples of fixed stack-dynamic arrays.

</div>

### Fixed Heap-Dynamic Array

A **fixed heap-dynamic array** is similar to a fixed stack-dynamic array, in that the subscript ranges and the storage binding are *both fixed* after storage is allocated.

The differences are that

- Both the subscript ranges and storage bindings are done when the user program requests them *during execution*.
- The storage is allocated from the heap, rather than the stack.

The advantage of fixed heap-dynamic arrays is flexibility—the array’s size always fits the problem.

The disadvantage is allocation time from the heap, which is longer than allocation time from the stack.

<div class="alert-example">

C and C++ also provide fixed heap-dynamic arrays.

- The standard C library functions `malloc` and `free`, which are general heap allocation and deallocation operations, respectively, can be used for C arrays.
- C++ uses the operators `new` and `delete` to manage heap storage.

An array is treated as a pointer to a collection of storage cells, where the pointer can be indexed, as discussed in 6-11.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

- In Java, all non-generic arrays are fixed heap-dynamic. Once created, these arrays keep the same subscript ranges and storage.
- C# also provides fixed heap-dynamic arrays.

</div>

### Heap-Dynamic Array

A **heap-dynamic array** is one in which the binding of subscript ranges and storage allocation is dynamic and can change any number of times during the array’s lifetime.

- The advantage of heap-dynamic arrays over the others is flexibility: Arrays can grow and shrink during program execution as the need for space changes.
- The disadvantage is that allocation and deallocation take longer and may happen many times during execution of the program.

<div class="alert-example">

Objects of the C# `List` class are generic heap-dynamic arrays. These array objects are created without any elements, as in

```csharp
List<String> stringList = new List<String>();
```

Elements are added to this object with the `Add()` method, as in

```csharp
stringList.Add("Michael");
```

Access to elements of these arrays is through subscripting.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Java includes a generic class similar to C#’s `List`, named `ArrayList`.

It is different from C#’s `List` in that subscripting is not supported—`get()` and `set()` methods must be used to access the elements.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

A Perl array can be made to grow by using the

- `push` (puts one or more new elements on the end of the array)
- `unshift` (puts one or more new elements on the beginning of the array)
- or by assigning a value to the array specifying a subscript beyond the highest current subscript of the array.

An array can be made to shrink to no elements by assigning it the empty list, `()`. The length of an array is defined to be the largest subscript plus one.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Like Perl, JavaScript allows arrays to grow with the `push` and `unshift` methods and shrink by setting them to the empty list. However, negative subscripts are not supported.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

JavaScript arrays can be *sparse*, meaning the subscript values need not be contiguous.

Suppose we have an array named list that has 10 elements with the subscripts 0..9.

Consider the following assignment statement:

```
list[50] = 42;
```

- Now, `list` has 11 elements and length 51.
- The elements with subscripts 11..49 are not defined and therefore do not require storage.
- A reference to a nonexistent element in a JavaScript array yields `undefined`.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

- Arrays in Python and Ruby can be made to grow only through methods to add elements or catenate other arrays.
- Ruby and Perl support negative subscripts, but Python does not.
- In Python an element or slice of an array can be deleted.
- A reference to a nonexistent element in Python results in a run-time error, whereas a similar reference in Ruby yields `nil` and no error is reported.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Swift dynamic arrays are objects that use integer subscripts, beginning at zero, and include several useful methods.

- The `append` method adds an element to the end of an array.
- The `insert` method inserts a new element at any position in the array, but results in an error if the insertion is at a subscript beyond the current length of the array.
- Elements can be removed from an array with the `removeAtIndex` method.
- There are also `reverse` and `count` methods.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Although the ML definition does not include arrays, its widely used implementation, SML/NJ, does.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

The only predefined collection type that is part of F# is the array (other collection types are provided through the .NET Framework Library).

- These arrays are like those of C#.
- A `foreach` statement is included in the language for array processing.

</div>

## Array Initialization

Some languages provide the means to initialize arrays at the time their storage
is allocated.

<div class="alert-example">

C, C++, Java, Swift, and C# allow initialization of their arrays. Consider the following C declaration:

```c
int list[] = {4, 5, 7, 83};
```

The array `list` is created and initialized with the values 4, 5, 7, and 83.

The compiler also sets the length of the array.

- This is meant to be a convenience but is not without cost.
- It effectively removes the possibility that the system could detect some kinds of programmer errors, such as mistakenly leaving a value out of the list.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

As discussed in 6-3, character strings in C and C++ are implemented as arrays of `char`. These arrays can be initialized to string constants, as in

```c
char name[] = "freddie";
```

The array name will have eight elements, because all strings are terminated with a null character (`'\0'`), which is implicitly supplied by the system for string constants.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Arrays of strings in C and C++ can also be initialized with string literals. For example,

```c
char *names[] = {"Bob", "Jake", "Darcie"};
```

This example illustrates the nature of character literals in C and C++.

- In the *previous example* of a string literal being used to initialize the `char` array `name`, the literal is taken to be a `char` array.
- But in the latter example (`names`), the literals are taken to be pointers to characters, so the array is an array of pointers to characters.

For example, `names[0]` is a pointer to the letter `'B'` in the literal character array that contains the characters `'B'`, `'o'`, `'b'`, and the null character.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

In Java, similar syntax is used to define and initialize an array of references to `String` objects.

```java
String[] names = ["Bob", "Jake", "Darcie"];
```

</div>

## Array Operations

An array operation is one that operates on an array as a unit.

<div class="alert-example">

The C-based languages do not provide any array operations, except through the methods of Java, C++, and C#.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Perl supports array assignments but does not support comparisons.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Python’s arrays are called lists, although they have all the characteristics of dynamic arrays. Because the objects can be of any types, these arrays are heterogeneous.

- Python provides array assignment, although it is only a reference change.
- Python also has operations for array catenation (`+`) and element membership (`in`).
- It includes two different comparison operators:
    - One that determines whether the two variables reference the same object (`is`).
    - One that compares all corresponding objects in the referenced objects, regardless of how deeply they are nested, for equality (`==`).

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

- The elements of Ruby’s arrays are references to objects.
- When a `==` operator is used between two arrays, the result is true only if the two arrays have the same length and the corresponding elements are equal.
- Ruby’s arrays can be catenated with an `Array` method.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

F# includes many array operators in its `Array` module. Among these are

- `Array.append`
- `Array.copy`
- `Array.length`

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Arrays and their operations are the heart of APL; it is the most powerful array-processing language ever devised.

In APL, the four basic arithmetic operations are defined for vectors (single-dimensioned arrays) and matrices, as well as scalar operands. For example,

```apl
A + B
```

is a valid expression, whether `A` and `B` are scalar variables, vectors, or matrices.

APL includes a collection of unary operators for vectors and matrices, some of which are as follows (where `V` is a vector and `M` is a matrix):

| Unary Operators | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⌽V              | reverses the elements of V                                     |
| ⌽M              | reverses the columns of M                                      |
| ⊖M              | reverses the rows of M                                         |
| ⍉M              | transposes M<br />(its rows become its columns and vice versa) |
| ÷M              | inverts M                                                      |

APL also includes several special operators that take other operators as operands.

One of these is the inner product operator, which is specified with a period (`.`). It takes two operands, which are binary operators. For example,

```apl
+.×
```

is a new operator that takes two arguments, either vectors or matrices. It first multiplies the corresponding elements of two arguments, and then it sums the results. For example, if `A` and `B` are vectors,

```apl
A × B
```

is the mathematical inner product of A and B (a vector of the products of the corresponding elements of `A` and `B`). The statement

```apl
A +.× B
```

is the sum of the inner product of `A` and `B`. If `A` and `B` are matrices, this expression specifies the matrix multiplication of `A` and `B`.

The special operators of APL are actually functional forms, which are described in Chapter 15.

</div>

## Rectangular and Jagged Arrays

- A **rectangular array** is a multidimensioned array in which all of the rows have the same number of elements and all of the columns have the same number of elements. Rectangular arrays model rectangular tables exactly.

- A **jagged array** is one in which the lengths of the rows need not be the same.

    For example, a jagged matrix may consist of three rows, one with 5 elements, one with 7 elements, and one with 12 elements.

    This also applies to the columns and higher dimensions. So, if there is a third dimension (layers), each layer can have a different number of elements.

    Jagged arrays are made possible when multidimensioned arrays are actually arrays of arrays. For example, a matrix would appear as an array of single-dimensioned arrays.

<div class="alert-example">

C, C++, and Java support jagged arrays but not rectangular arrays. In those languages, a reference to an element of a multidimensioned array uses a separate pair of brackets for each dimension. For example,

```c
myArray[3][7]
```

?> 並不直接支援 Rectangular Arrays，因為在這些語言中，多維陣列實際上是陣列的陣列，每個子陣列可以有不同的長度。因此，這些語言的多維陣列實際上是「不規則」的。

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

C# and F# support both rectangular and jagged arrays. For rectangular arrays, all subscript expressions in references to elements are placed in a single pair of brackets. For example,

```csharp
myArray[3, 7]
```

</div>

## Slices

A **slice** of an array is some substructure of that array.

For example, if `A` is a matrix, then the first row of `A` is one possible slice, as are the last row and the first column.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following Python declarations:

```python
vector = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
```

- Recall that the default lower bound for Python arrays is 0.
- The syntax of a Python slice reference is a pair of numeric expressions separated by a colon (`:`).
    - The first is the first subscript of the slice;
    - the second is the first subscript after the last subscript in the slice.

Therefore, `vector[3:6]` is a three-element array with the fourth through sixth elements of `vector` (those elements with the subscripts 3, 4, and 5).

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Python also supports more complex slices of arrays.

```python
vector = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
```

`vector[0:7:2]` references every other element of `vector`, up to but not including the element with the subscript 7, starting with the subscript 0, which is `[2, 6, 10, 14]`.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following Python declarations:

```python
mat = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
```

- A row of a matrix is specified by giving just one subscript.

    For example, `mat[1]` refers to the second row of `mat`.

- A part of a row can be specified with the same syntax as a part of a single-dimensioned array.

    For example, `mat[0][0:2]` refers to the first and second element of the first row of `mat`, which is `[1, 2]`.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Perl supports slices of two forms, a list of specific subscripts or a range of subscripts. For example,

```perl
@list[1..5] = @list2[3, 5, 7, 9, 13];
```

Notice that slice references use array names, not scalar names, because slices are arrays (not scalars).

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Ruby supports slices with the `slice` method of its `Array` object, which can take three forms of parameters.

- A single integer expression parameter is interpreted as a subscript, in which case `slice` returns the element with the given subscript.
- If `slice` is given two integer expression parameters, the first is interpreted as a beginning subscript and the second is interpreted as the number of elements in the slice.

    For example, suppose `list` is defined as follows:

    ```ruby
    list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

    `list.slice(2, 2)` returns `[6, 8]`.

- The third parameter form for `slice` is a range, which has the form of an integer expression, two periods, and a second integer expression. With a range parameter, `slice` returns an array of the element with the given range of subscripts.

    For example, `list.slice (1..3)` returns `[4, 6, 8]`.

</div>

## Implementation of Array Types

Implementing arrays requires considerably more compile-time effort than does implementing primitive types.

- The code to allow accessing of array elements must be generated at compile time.
- At run time, this code must be executed to produce element addresses.
- There is no way to *pre*compute the address to be accessed by a reference such as `list[k]`

### Single-Dimensioned Array

A single-dimensioned array is implemented as a list of adjacent memory cells.

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose the array `list` is defined to have a subscript range lower bound of 0. The access function for `list` is often of the form

$$
\text{address(list[k]) = address(list[0]) + k $\times$ element_size}
$$

where the first operand of the addition is the *constant part* of the access function, and the second is the *variable part*.

- If the element type is statically bound and the array is statically bound to storage, then the value of the constant part can be computed before run time.
- However, the addition and multiplication operations must be done at run time.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

The generalization of this access function for an arbitrary lower bound is

$$
\begin{align}
\text{address(list[k]) = } & \text{address(list[lower_bound])} \\
& + \text{((k $-$ lower_bound) $\times$ element_size)}
\end{align}
$$

</div>

![](./img/6.4.jpg ':figure :size=20% Compile-time descriptor for single-dimensioned arrays.')

The descriptor includes information required to construct the access function.

- If run-time checking of index ranges is not done and the attributes are all static, then
    - only the access function is required during execution;
    - no descriptor is needed.
- If run-time checking of index ranges is done, then
    - those index ranges may need to be stored in a run-time descriptor.
- If the subscript ranges of a particular array type are static, then
    - the ranges may be incorporated into the code that does the checking,
    - thus eliminating the need for the run-time descriptor.
- If any of the descriptor entries are dynamically bound, then
    - those parts of the descriptor must be maintained at run time.

### Multidimensional Array

True multidimensional arrays, that is, those that are not arrays of arrays, are more complex to implement than single-dimensioned arrays, although the extension to more dimensions is straightforward.

Hardware memory is *linear*—just a simple sequence of bytes. So values of data types that have two or more dimensions must be mapped onto the single-dimensioned memory.

There are two ways in which multidimensional arrays can be mapped to one dimension:

- Row major order.
- Column major order (not used in any widely used language).

In **row major order**, the elements of the array that have as their first subscript the lower bound value of that subscript are stored first, followed by the elements of the second value of the first subscript, and so forth.

<div class="alert-example">

If the array is a matrix, it is stored by rows. For example, if the matrix had the values

```text
3 4 7
6 2 5
1 3 8
```

it would be stored in row major order as

```text
3, 4, 7, 6, 2, 5, 1, 3, 8
```

</div>

![](./img/6.5.jpg ':figure :size=40% The location of the [i, j] element in a matrix.')

The access function can be written as

$$
\text{location(a[i, j]) = address(a[0, 0]) + (((i $\times$ n) + j) $\times$ element_size)}
$$

- The number of rows above the ith row is $i$.
- the number of elements to the left of the jth column is $j$.
- $n$ is the number of elements per row.
- The first term is the constant part and the last is the variable part.

The generalization to *arbitrary lower bounds* results in the following access function:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{location(a[i, j]) =}
& \text{ address(a[row$_\text{lb}$, col$_\text{lb}$])} \\
& + \text{(((i - row$_\text{lb}$) $\times$ n) + (j - col$_\text{lb}$)) $\times$ element_size}
\end{align}
$$

This can be rearranged to the form

$$
\begin{align}
\text{location(a[i, j]) =}
& \text{ address(a[row$_\text{lb}$, col$_\text{lb}$])} \\
& - \text{(((row$_\text{lb}$ $\times$ n) + col$_\text{lb}$) $\times$ element_size)} \\
& + \text{(((i $\times$ n) + j) $\times$ element_size)} \\
\end{align}
$$

- where the first two terms are the constant part and the last is the variable part.
- This can be generalized rather easily to an arbitrary number of dimensions.

For each dimension of an array, one add and one multiply instruction are required for the access function. Therefore, accesses to elements of arrays with several subscripts are *costly*.

The compile-time descriptor for a multidimensional array is shown in Figure 6.6.

![](./img/6.6.jpg ':figure :size=35% A compile-time descriptor for a multidimensional array.')

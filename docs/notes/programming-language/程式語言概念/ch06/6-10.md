# Union Types

A **union** is a type whose variables may store different type values at different times during program execution.

<div class="alert-example">

As an example of the need for a union type, consider a table of constants for a compiler,

- which is used to store the constants found in a program being compiled.
- One field of each table entry is for the value of the constant.

Suppose that for a particular language being compiled, the types of constants were

- Integer
- Floating-point
- Boolean.

In terms of table management,

?> it would be convenient if the same location, a table field, could store a value of any of these three types. Then all constant values could be addressed in the same way.

The type of such a location is, in a sense, the union of the three value types it can store.

## Discriminated vs. Free Unions

C and C++ provide union constructs in which there is *no* language support for *type checking*.

In C and C++, the `union` construct is used to specify union structures. The unions in these languages are called **free unions**, because programmers are allowed complete freedom from type checking in their use.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following C union:

```c
// union 的所有成員共用相同的記憶體，大小等於最大成員的大小
union flexType {
    int intEl;
    float floatEl; 
};

union flexType el1;
float x;
...
// 存取成員時無法確定當前是哪個成員有效
el1.intEl = 27;  // 以整數的儲存格式儲存
x = el1.floatEl; // 卻以浮點數的儲存格式讀取，可能導致未定義行為
```

This last assignment is not type checked, because the system cannot determine the current type of the current value of `el1`, so it assigns the bit string representation of `27` to the `float` variable `x`, which, of course, is nonsense.

</div>

*Type checking* of unions requires that each union construct include a type indicator. Such an indicator is called a **tag**, or **discriminant**, and a union with a discriminant is called a **discriminated union**.

<div class="alert-example">

A union is declared in F# with a type statement using OR operators (`|`) to define the components.

For example, we could have the following:

```fsharp
type intReal =
    | IntValue of int
    | RealValue of float;;
```

In this example,

- `intReal` is the union type.
- `IntValue` and `RealValue` are constructors.

Values of type `intReal` can be created using the constructors as if they were a function, as in the following examples:

```fsharp
let ir1 = IntValue 17;;
let ir2 = RealValue 3.4;;
```

Accessing the value of a union is done with a pattern-matching structure. Pattern matching in F# is specified with the `match` reserved word:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Pattern matching in F\#}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state \textbf{match} pattern \textbf{with}
\state $\hspace{2em}$ | expression\_list$_1$ -> expression$_1$
\state $\hspace{2em}$ | ...
\state $\hspace{2em}$ | expression\_list$_n$ -> expression$_n$

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The pattern can be any data type. The expression list can include wild
card characters (`_`) or be solely a wild card character. For example, consider the
following match construct:

```fsharp
let a = 7;;
let b = "grape";;
let x = match (a, b) with
    | 4, "apple" -> apple
    | _, "grape" -> grape
    | _ -> fruit;;
```

To display the type of the `intReal` union, the following function could be used:

```fsharp
let printType value =
    match value with
        | IntValue value -> printfn "It is an integer"
        | RealValue value -> printfn "It is a float";;
```

The following lines show calls to this function and the output:

```fsharp
printType ir1;;
printType ir2;;
```

```text
It is an integer
It is a float
```

</div>

## Evaluation

- Unions are potentially unsafe constructs in some languages. They are one of the reasons why C and C++ are not strongly typed: These languages do not allow type checking of references to their unions.
- On the other hand, unions can be safely used, as in their design in ML, Haskell, and F#.
- Neither Java nor C# includes unions, which may be reflective of the growing concern for safety in some programming languages.

## Implementation of Union Types

<div class="alert-note">

- Unions are implemented by simply using the *same address* for every possible variant.
- Sufficient storage for the *largest* variant is allocated.

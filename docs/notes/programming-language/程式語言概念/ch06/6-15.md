# Type Equivalence

***Type Compatibility***

The idea of type compatibility was defined when the issue of type checking ([6-13][]) was introduced.

[6-13]: /notes/programming-language/程式語言概念/ch06/6-13

The compatibility rules

- Dictate the types of operands that are acceptable for each of the operators.
- Thereby specify the possible type errors of the language.

The rules are called compatibility because in some cases the type of an operand can be implicitly converted by the compiler or run-time system to make it acceptable for the operator.

---

- Object-oriented languages such as Java and C++ bring another kind of type compatibility issue with them. The issue is object compatibility and its relationship to the inheritance hierarchy, which is discussed in Chapter 12.
- Type compatibility in expressions is discussed in Chapter 7.
- Type compatibility for subprogram parameters is discussed in Chapter 9.

***Type Equivalence***

- The type compatibility rules are simple and rigid for the predefined *scalar types*.
- However, in the cases of *structured types*, such as arrays and records and some user-defined types, the rules are more complex. Coercion of these types is rare, so the issue is not type compatibility, but type equivalence.

That is, two types are **equivalent** if an operand of one type in an expression can be substituted for one of the other type, without coercion. Type equivalence is a strict form of type compatibility—compatibility without coercion.

Perhaps the most important result of two variables being of equivalent types is that either one can have its value assigned to the other.

There are two approaches to defining type equivalence:

- Name type equivalence
- Structure type equivalence

## Name Type Equivalence

**Name type equivalence** means that two variables have equivalent types if they are defined either in the same declaration or in declarations that use the same type name.

In languages that do not allow users to define and name types, such as Fortran and COBOL, name equivalence obviously cannot be used.

Name type equivalence is easy to implement but is more restrictive. Under a strict interpretation, a variable whose type is a subrange of the integers would not be equivalent to an integer type variable.

<div class="alert-example">

Supposing Ada used *strict* name type equivalence, consider the following Ada code:

```ada
type Indextype is 1..100;
count : Integer;
index : Indextype;
```

The types of the variables `count` and `index` would not be equivalent; `count` could not be assigned to `index` or vice versa.

</div>

Another problem with name type equivalence arises when a structured or user-defined type is passed among subprograms through parameters.

- Such a type must be defined only once, globally.
- A subprogram cannot state the type of such formal parameters in local terms.

<div class="alert-example">

若型別 `Point` 沒有在全域範圍內定義，Name type equivalence 會認為這些是不同的型別，即使它們的結構完全相同。

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void functionA() {
    // 副程式 A 定義自己的結構型別
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };
    
    struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
    printf("Point in functionA: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);
}

void functionB(struct Point p) { // 未知型別 'struct Point'
    printf("Point in functionB: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
}

int main() {
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    }; // 全域範圍中沒有定義這個型別，副程式 A 和 B 的型別無法匹配

    struct Point p = {3, 4};
    functionA();
    functionB(p); // 編譯錯誤

    return 0;
}
```

<!-- tab: 改進後 -->

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// 全域定義結構型別
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

// 副程式使用全域型別
void functionA() {
    struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
    printf("Point in functionA: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);
}

void functionB(struct Point p) {
    printf("Point in functionB: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
}

int main() {
    struct Point p = {3, 4};
    functionA();
    functionB(p); // 現在合法

    return 0;
}
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

</div>

Note that to use name type equivalence, all types must have names. Most languages allow users to define types that are anonymous—they do not have names. For a language to use name type equivalence, such types must implicitly be given *internal names* by the compiler.

## Structure Type Equivalence

**Structure type equivalence** means that two variables have equivalent types if their types have identical structures.

Structure type equivalence is more flexible than name type equivalence, but it is more difficult to implement.

- Under name type equivalence, only the two type names must be compared to determine equivalence.
- Under structure type equivalence, however, the entire structures of the two types must be compared.

This comparison is not always simple. (Consider a data structure that refers to its own type, such as a linked list.) Other questions can also arise.

<div class="alert-example">

- Are two record (or `struct`) types equivalent if they have the same structure but different field names?
- Are two single-dimensioned array types in a language that allows lower bounds of array subscript ranges to be set in their declarations equivalent if they have the same element type but have subscript ranges of `0..10` and `1..11`?
- Are two enumeration types equivalent if they have the same number of components but spell the literals differently?

</div>

## Example in Ada

Another difficulty with structure type equivalence is that it disallows differentiating between types with the same structure.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following Ada-like declarations:

```ada
-- 結構相同，都是浮點數，視為等價；
-- 但從型別名稱來看，攝氏與華氏為不同概念，等價是不合理的。
type Celsius = Float;
     Fahrenheit = Float;
```

- The types of variables of these two types are considered equivalent under structure type equivalence, allowing them to be mixed in expressions,
- which is surely undesirable in this case, considering the difference indicated by the type’s names.

In general, types with different names are likely to be abstractions of different categories of problem values and should not be considered equivalent.

</div>

Ada uses a restrictive form of name type equivalence but provides two type
constructs,

- Subtypes
- Derived types

that avoid the problems associated with name type equivalence.

<div class="alert-example">

?> A **derived type** is a new type that is based on some previously defined type with which it is not equivalent, although it may have identical structure. Derived types inherit all the properties of their parent types.

Consider the following example:

```ada
type Celsius is new Float;
type Fahrenheit is new Float;
```

- The types of variables of these two derived types are not equivalent, although their structures are identical.
- Furthermore, variables of neither type is type equivalent with any other floating-point type.

Literals are exempt from the rule. A literal such as `3.0` has the type universal real and is type equivalent to any floating-point type.

Derived types can also include range constraints on the parent type, while still inheriting all of the parent’s operations.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> An Ada **subtype** is a possibly range-constrained version of an existing type. A subtype is type equivalent with its parent type.

Consider the following declaration:

```ada
subtype Small_type is Integer range 0..99;
```

The type `Small_type` is equivalent to the type `Integer`.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> Note that Ada’s derived types are very *different* from Ada’s subrange types.

Consider the following type declarations:

```ada
type Derived_Small_Int is new Integer range 1..100;
subtype Subrange_Small_Int is Integer range 1..100;
```

Variables of both types, `Derived_Small_Int` and `Subrange_Small_Int`, have the same range of legal values and both inherit the operations of `Integer`. However,

- Variables of type `Derived_Small_Int` are not compatible with any `Integer` type.
- Variables of type `Subrange_Small_Int` are compatible with variables and constants of `Integer` type and any subtype of `Integer`.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> For variables of an Ada unconstrained array type, structure type equivalence is used.

Consider the following type declaration and two object declarations:

```ada
type Vector is array (Integer range <>) of Integer;
Vector_1: Vector (1..10);
Vector_2: Vector (11..20);
```

The types of these two objects are equivalent.

- Even though they have different names and different subscript ranges.
- Objects of unconstrained array types use structure type equivalence rather than name type equivalence.
- Because both types have 10 elements and the elements of both are of type `Integer`, they are type equivalent.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> For constrained anonymous types, Ada uses a highly restrictive form of name type equivalence.

Consider the following Ada declarations of constrained anonymous types:

```ada
A : array (1..10) of Integer;
```

In this case, `A` has an anonymous but *unique* type assigned by the compiler and unavailable to the program. If we also had

```ada
B : array (1..10) of Integer;
```

`A` and `B` would be of anonymous but distinct and not equivalent types, though they are structurally identical. The multiple declaration

```ada
C, D : array (1..10) of Integer;
```

creates two anonymous types, one for `C` and one for `D`, which are not equivalent. This declaration is actually treated as if it were the following two declarations:

```ada
C : array (1..10) of Integer;
D : array (1..10) of Integer;
```

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> Note that Ada’s form of name type equivalence is more restrictive than the name type equivalence that is defined at the beginning of this section.

If we had written instead

```ada
type List_10 is array (1..10) of Integer;
C, D : List_10;
```

then the types of `C` and `D` would be equivalent.

Name type equivalence works well for Ada, in part because all types, except anonymous arrays, are required to have type names (and anonymous types are given internal names by the compiler).

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

?> Type equivalence rules for Ada are more rigid than those for languages that have many coercions among types.

- The two operands of an addition operator in Java can have virtually any combination of numeric types in the language. One of the operands will simply be coerced to the type of the other.
- But in Ada, there are no coercions of the operands of an arithmetic operator.

</div>

## Example in C and C++

C uses both name and structure type equivalence.

- Every `struct`, `enum`, and `union` declaration creates a new type that is not equivalent to any other type. So, name type equivalence is used for structure, enumeration, and union types.

    One exception to C using name type equivalence for structures, enumerations, and unions is if two structures, enumerations, or unions are defined in different files, in which case structural type equivalence is used.

    This is a loophole in the name type equivalence rule to allow equivalence of structures, enumerations, and unions that are defined in different files.

- Other nonscalar types use structure type equivalence.

- Array types are equivalent if they have the same type components. Also, if an array type has a constant size, it is equivalent either to other arrays with the same constant size or to with those without a constant size.

- Note that `typedef` in C and C++ does not introduce a new type; it simply defines a new name for an existing type. So, any type defined with `typedef` is type equivalent to its parent type.

C++ is like C except there is no exception for structures and unions defined in different files.

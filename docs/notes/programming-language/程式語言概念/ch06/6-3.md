# Character String Types

A **character string type** is one in which the values consist of sequences of characters.

A **substring reference** is a reference to a substring of a given string. Substring references are discussed in the more general context of arrays, where the substring references are called **slices**.

## String Types in Certain Languages

### String in C and C++

If strings are not defined as a primitive type, string data is usually stored in *arrays of single characters* and referenced as such in the language. This is the approach taken by C and C++, which use `char` arrays to store character strings.

Character strings are terminated with a special character, null (`'\0'`), which is represented with zero.

- This is an alternative to maintaining the length of string variables.
- The library operations simply carry out their operations until the null character appears in the string being operated on.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following declaration:

```c
char str[] = "apples";
```

In this example, `str` represents an array of `char` elements, specifically `apples0`, where `0` is the null character.

</div>

#### C String Library

Some of the most commonly used library functions for character strings in C and C++ are

- `strcpy`, which moves strings;
- `strcat`, which catenates one given string onto another;
- `strcmp`, which lexicographically compares (by the order of their character codes) two given strings;
- `strlen`, which returns the number of characters, not counting the null character, in the given string.

The parameters and return values for most of the string manipulation functions are `char` pointers that point to arrays of `char`. Parameters can also be string literals.

<div class="alert-warning">

- The string manipulation functions of the C standard library, which are also available in C++, are inherently *unsafe* and have led to numerous programming errors.
- The problem is that the functions in this library that move string data do not guard against overflowing the destination.

Consider the following call to `strcpy`:

```c
strcpy(dest, src);
```

`strcpy` does not know the length of `dest`

- It cannot ensure that the memory following it will not be *overwritten*.
- If the length of `dest` is 20 and the length of `src` is 50, `strcpy` will write over the 30 bytes that follow `dest`.
- The same problem can occur with several of the other functions in the C string library.

</div>

#### C++ String Class

<div class="alert-note">

Because of the *insecurities* of the C string library,

- C++ programmers should use the `string` class from the standard library,
- rather than `char` arrays and the C string library.

</div>

### String in Java

In Java, strings are supported by

- The `String` class, whose values are *constant* strings.
- The `StringBuffer` class, whose values are *changeable* and are more like arrays of single characters.

C# and Ruby include string classes that are similar to those of Java.

### String in Python

Python includes strings as a *primitive type*.

- String has operations for substring reference, catenation, indexing to access individual characters, as well as methods for searching and replacement.
- Strings are *immutable*, similar to the `String` class objects of Java.

### String in F#, ML and Swift

In F#, strings are a class.

- Individual characters, which are represented in Unicode UTF-16, can be accessed, but not changed.
- Strings can be catenated with the `+` operator.

In ML, string is a primitive immutable type.

- It uses `^` for its catenation operator.
- It includes functions for substring referencing and getting the size of a string.

In Swift, the String class supports its character strings.

- String objects can be either constants or variables.
- The binary `+` operator catenates String variables.
- The append method is used to add a Character object to a String object.
- The characters method of String is used to examine individual characters of a String object.

## Regular Expressions

Perl, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP include built-in pattern-matching operations. In these languages, the pattern-matching expressions are somewhat loosely based on mathematical regular expressions. In fact, they are often called **regular expressions**.

Pattern-matching capabilities using regular expressions are included in the class libraries of C++, Java, Python, C#, and F#.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following pattern expression:

```regex
/[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\d]+/
```

This pattern matches (or describes) the typical name form in programming languages.

The brackets enclose character classes.

- The first character class specifies all letters;
- The second specifies all letters and digits (a digit is specified with the abbreviation `\d`).
- The plus operator (`+`) following the second category specifies that there must be one or more of what is in the category.

So, the whole pattern matches strings that begin with a letter, followed by one or more letters or digits.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Next, consider the following pattern expression:

```regex
/\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+/
```

This pattern matches numeric literals.

- The `\.` specifies a literal decimal point.
- The question mark (`?`) quantifies what it follows to have zero or one appearance.
- The vertical bar (`|`) separates two alternatives in the whole pattern.
    - The first alternative matches strings of one or more digits, possibly followed by a decimal point, followed by zero or more digits;
    - The second alternative matches strings that begin with a decimal point, followed by one or more digits.

</div>

## String Length Options

There are several design choices regarding the length of string values.

- First, the length can be static and set when the string is created. Such a string is called a **static length string**.
  
  <div class="alert-example">

    This is the choice for

    - Strings of Python,
    - Java’s `String` class,
    - C++ standard class library,
    - Ruby’s built-in `String` class,
    - .NET class library available to C# and F#.

  </div>

- The second option is to allow strings to have varying length up to a declared and fixed maximum set by the variable’s definition, as exemplified by the strings in C and the C-style strings of C++. These are called **limited dynamic length strings**.

    Such string variables can store any number of characters *between zero and the maximum*. Recall that strings in C use a special character to indicate the end of the string’s characters, rather than maintaining the string length.

- The third option is to allow strings to have varying length with no maximum, as in JavaScript, Perl, and the standard C++ library. These are called **dynamic length strings**.

    This option requires the overhead of dynamic storage allocation and deallocation but provides maximum flexibility.

### Implementation of Character String Types

A descriptor for a *static character string* type, which is required only during compilation, has three fields.

- The name of the type.
- The type’s length (in characters).
- The address of the first character.

![](./img/6.2.jpg ':figure :size=40% Compile-time descriptor for static strings.')

*Limited dynamic strings* require a runtime descriptor to store

- The fixed maximum length.
- The current length.
- The address.

![](./img/6.3.jpg ':figure :size=40% Run-time descriptor for limited dynamic strings.')

*Dynamic length strings* require a simpler run-time descriptor because only

- the current length and
- the address need to be stored.

Although we depict descriptors as independent blocks of storage, in most cases, they are stored in the symbol table.

<div class="alert-attention">

The limited dynamic strings of C and C++ do *not* require run-time descriptors, because the end of a string is marked with the null character. They do not need the maximum length, because index values in array references are not range checked in these languages.

</div>

### Storage Allocation

- *Static length* and *limited dynamic length* strings require no special dynamic storage allocation.

    In the case of limited dynamic length strings, sufficient storage for the maximum length is allocated when the string variable is bound to storage, so only a single allocation process is involved.

- *Dynamic length* strings require more complex storage management. The length of a string, and therefore the storage to which it is bound, must grow and shrink dynamically.

    There are three approaches to supporting the dynamic allocation and deallocation that is required for dynamic length strings.

    - First, strings can be stored in a *linked list*, so that when a string grows, the newly required cells can come from anywhere in the heap. The drawbacks to this method are the extra storage occupied by the links in the list representation and the necessary complexity of string operations.

    - The second approach is to store strings as *arrays of pointers to individual characters* allocated in the heap. This method still uses extra memory, but string processing can be faster than with the linked-list approach.

    - The third alternative is to store complete strings in *adjacent storage cells*.

      <div class="alert-attention">

      The problem with this method arises when a string grows: How can storage that is adjacent to the existing cells continue to be allocated for the string variable?

        - Frequently, such storage is not available.
        - Instead, a new area of memory is found that can store the complete new string, and the old part is moved to this area. Then, the memory cells used for the old string are deallocated.

      </div>

***Comparison***

Although the linked-list method

- Requires more storage, the associated allocation and deallocation processes are simple.
- However, some string operations are slowed by the required pointer chasing.

On the other hand, using adjacent memory for complete strings

- Results in faster string operations.
- Requires significantly less storage, but the allocation and deallocation processes are slower.

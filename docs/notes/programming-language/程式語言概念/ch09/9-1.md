# Introduction

Two fundamental abstraction facilities can be included in a programming language:

- Process abstraction (subprogram).
- Data abstraction ([Chapter 11][]).

***Methods (in OOP) vs. Subprogram***

The *methods* of object-oriented languages are closely related to the
subprograms discussed in this chapter.

- The primary way methods differ from subprograms is the way they are called and their associations with classes and objects.
- Although these special characteristics of methods are discussed in [Chapter 12][], the features they share with subprograms, such as parameters and local variables, are discussed in this chapter.

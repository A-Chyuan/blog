# Coroutines

A **coroutine** is a special kind of subprogram.

- Rather than the master-slave relationship between a caller and a called subprogram that exists with conventional subprograms,
- caller and called coroutines are more equitable. In fact, the coroutine control mechanism is often called the **symmetric unit control model**.

1. Coroutines can have multiple entry points, which are controlled by the coroutines themselves.
2. They also have the means to maintain their status between activations.
3. This means that coroutines must be history sensitive and thus have static local variables.
4. Secondary executions of a coroutine often begin at points other than its beginning.
5. Because of this, the invocation of a coroutine is called a **resume** rather than a call.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following skeletal coroutine:

```
sub co1(){
    ...
    resume co2();
    ...
    resume co3();
    ...
}
```

The first time `co1` is resumed,

- its execution begins at the first statement and
- executes down to and including the resume of `co2`, which transfers control to `co2`.

The next time `co1` is resumed,

- its execution begins at the first statement after its call to `co2`.

When `co1` is resumed the third time,

- its execution begins at the first statement after the resume of `co3`.

</div>

One of the usual characteristics of subprograms is maintained in coroutines:

?> Only one coroutine is actually in execution at a given time.

As seen in the example above, rather than executing to its end,

- a coroutine often partially executes and then transfers control to some other coroutine, and
- when restarted, a coroutine resumes execution just after the statement it used to transfer control elsewhere.

***Quasi-Concurrency***

This sort of interleaved execution sequence is related to the way multiprogramming operating systems work.

- Although there may be only one processor, all of the executing programs in such a system appear to run concurrently while sharing the processor.
- In the case of coroutines, this is sometimes called **quasi-concurrency**.

***Coroutine Management and Execution***

Typically, coroutines are created in an application by a program unit called the master unit, which is not a coroutine. When created, coroutines execute their initialization code and then return control to that master unit.

- When the entire family of coroutines is constructed, the master program resumes one of the coroutines, and the members of the family of coroutines then resume each other in some order until their work is completed, if in fact it can be completed.
- If the execution of a coroutine reaches the end of its code section, control is transferred to the master unit that created it. This is the mechanism for ending execution of the collection of coroutines, when that is desirable.
- In some programs, the coroutines run whenever the computer is running. (無止盡的執行)

<div class="alert-example">

One example of a problem that can be solved with this sort of collection of coroutines is a *card game simulation*. Suppose the game has four players who all use the same strategy.

- Such a game can be simulated by having a master program unit create a family of four coroutines, each with a collection of cards.
- The master program could then start the simulation by resuming one of the player coroutines, which, after it had played its turn, could resume the next player coroutine, and so forth until the game ended.

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose program units `A` and `B` are coroutines. Figure 9.3 shows two ways an execution sequence involving `A` and `B` might proceed.

![](./img/9.3.jpg ':figure Two possible execution control sequences for two coroutines without loops.')

In Figure 9.3a,

- the execution of coroutine `A` is started by the master unit.
- After some execution, `A` starts `B`.
- When coroutine `B` in Figure 9.3a first causes control to return to coroutine `A`, the semantics is that `A` continues from where it ended its last execution.

In particular, its local variables have the values left them by the previous activation.

Figure 9.3b shows an alternative execution sequence of coroutines `A` and `B`. In this case, `B` is started by the master unit.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/9.4.jpg ':figure Coroutine execution sequence with loops.')

Rather than have the patterns shown in Figure 9.3, a coroutine often has a loop containing a resume. Figure 9.4 shows the execution sequence of this scenario.

In this case, `A` is started by the master unit. Inside its main loop, `A` resumes `B`, which in turn resumes `A` in its main loop.

The generators of Python are a form of coroutines.

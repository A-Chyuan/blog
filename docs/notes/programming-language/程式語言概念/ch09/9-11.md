# User-Defined Overloaded Operators

Operators can be overloaded by the user in Ada, C++, Python, and Ruby.

***In Python***

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose that a Python class is developed to support complex numbers and arithmetic operations on them.

- A complex number can be represented with two floating-point values.
- The `Complex` class would have members for these two named `real` and `imag`.

In Python, binary arithmetic operations are implemented as method calls sent to the first operand, sending the second operand as a parameter.

- For addition, the method is named `__add__`. For example, the expression `x + y` is implemented as `x.__add__(y)`.

To overload `+` for the addition of objects of the new `Complex` class, we only need to provide `Complex` with a method named `__add__` that performs the operation. Following is such a method:

```python
def __add__ (self, second):
    return Complex(self.real + second.real, self.imag + second.imag)
```

- In most languages that support object-oriented programming, a reference to the current object is *implicitly* sent with each method call.
- In Python, this reference must be sent *explicitly*; that is the reason why `self` is the first parameter to our method, `__add__`.

***In C++***

<div class="alert-example">

The example add method could be written for a complex class in C++ as follows :

```cpp
Complex operator +(Complex &second) {
    return Complex(real + second.real, imag + second.imag);
}
```

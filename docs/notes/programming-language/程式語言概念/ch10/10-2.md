# Implementing “Simple” Subprograms

We begin with the task of implementing simple subprograms. By “simple” we mean that subprograms cannot be nested and all local variables are static.

## Call Semantics

<div class="stepper">

The semantics of a call to a “simple” subprogram requires the following actions:

- Save the execution status of the current program unit (caller).
- Compute and pass the parameters.
- Pass the return address to the called.
- Transfer control to the called.

</div>

## Return Semantics

<div class="stepper">

The semantics of a return from a simple subprogram requires the following actions:

- If there are pass-by-value-result or out-mode parameters, the current values of those parameters are moved to or made available to the corresponding actual parameters.
- If the subprogram is a function, the functional value is moved to a place accessible to the caller.
- Restore the execution status of the caller.
- Transfer control back to the caller.

</div>

## Required storage

The call and return actions require storage for the following:

- Status information about the caller
- Parameters
- Return address
- Return value for functions
- Temporaries used by the code of the subprograms

These, along with the local variables and the subprogram code, form the complete collection of information a subprogram needs to execute and then return control to the caller.

## Responsibilities of Call and Return

The question now is the distribution of the call and return actions to the caller and the called (callee).

***By Caller***

The last three actions of a [call][] clearly must be done by the caller.

[call]: /notes/programming-language/程式語言概念/ch10/10-2?id=call-semantics

***By Callee***

In the case of the [return][], the first, third, and fourth actions must be done by the called.

[return]: /notes/programming-language/程式語言概念/ch10/10-2?id=return-semantics

***By Either***

- Saving the execution status of the caller could be done by either.
- Once again, the restoration of the execution status of the caller could be done by either the caller or the called.

## Prologue and Epilogue

In general, the linkage actions of the called can occur at two different times, either at the *beginning* of its execution or at the *end*. These are sometimes called the

- **Prologue**
- **Epilogue**

of the subprogram linkage.

In the case of a simple subprogram, all of the linkage actions of the callee occur at the end of its execution, so there is no need for a prologue.

## Structure of a Simple Subprogram

A simple subprogram consists of two separate parts:

- The actual code of the subprogram, which is constant
- Non-code part: The local variables and data listed previously, which can change when the subprogram is executed.

In the case of simple subprograms, both of these parts have fixed sizes.

## Activation Record

The format, or layout, of the non-code part of an executing subprogram is called an **activation record**, because the data it describes are relevant only during the activation or execution of the subprogram. The form of an activation record is static.

<div class="alert-example">

Because languages with simple subprograms do not support recursion, there can be only one active version of a given subprogram at a time. Therefore, there can be only a single instance of the activation record for a subprogram.

One possible layout for activation records is shown in Figure 10.1.

![](./img/10.1.jpg ':figure :size=30% An activation record for simple subprogram.')

The saved execution status of the caller is omitted here and in the remainder of this chapter because it is simple and not relevant to the discussion.

</div>

## Activation Record Instance

An **activation record instance** is a concrete example of an activation record, a collection of data in the form of an activation record (the collection of data for a particular subprogram activation).

<div class="alert-example">

Because an activation record instance for a “simple” subprogram has fixed size, it can be statically allocated. In fact, it could be attached to the code part of the subprogram.

Figure 10.2 shows a program consisting of

- a main program `MAIM` and
- three subprograms: `A`, `B`, and `C`.

![](./img/10.2.jpg ':figure The code and activation records of a program with simple subprograms.')

Although the figure shows all the code segments separated from all the activation record instances, in some cases, the activation record instances are attached to their associated code segments.

The construction of the complete program shown in Figure 10.2 is not done entirely by the compiler.

- In fact, if the language allows independent compilation, the four program units—`MAIN`, `A`, `B`, and `C`—may have been compiled on different days, or even in different years.
- At the time each unit is compiled, the machine code for it, along with a list of references to external subprograms, is written to a file.

</div>

## Linker

<div class="alert-note">

The executable program shown in Figure 10.2 is put together by the **linker**, which is part of the operating system. (Sometimes linkers are called **loaders**, **linker/loaders**, or **link editors**.)

- When the linker is called for a main program, its first task is to find the files that contain the translated subprograms referenced in that program and load them into memory.
- Then, the linker must set the target addresses of all calls to those subprograms in the main program to the entry addresses of those subprograms. The same must be done for all calls to subprograms in the loaded subprograms and all calls to library subprograms.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

In the previous example, the linker was called for `MAIN`.

- The linker had to find the machine code programs for `A`, `B`, and `C`, along with their activation record instances, and load them into memory with the code for `MAIN`.
- Then, it had to patch in the target addresses for all calls to `A`, `B`, `C`, and any library subprograms called in `A`, `B`, `C`, and `MAIN`.

# Implementing Dynamic Scoping

There are at least two distinct ways in which local variables and nonlocal references to them can be implemented in a dynamic-scoped language:

- **Deep access**
- **Shallow access**

Note that deep access and shallow access are not concepts related to [deep and shallow binding][]. An important difference between binding and access is that deep and shallow bindings result in different semantics; deep and shallow accesses do not.

## Deep Access

If local variables are stack dynamic and are part of the activation records in a dynamic-scoped language,

- references to nonlocal variables can be resolved by searching through the activation record instances of the other subprograms that are currently active,
- beginning with the one most recently activated.

This concept is similar to that of accessing nonlocal variables in a static-scoped language with nested subprograms, except that the *dynamic*—rather than the static—*chain is followed*.

- The dynamic chain links together all subprogram activation record instances in the reverse of the order in which they were activated.
- Therefore, the dynamic chain is exactly what is needed to reference nonlocal variables in a dynamic-scoped language.

This method is called **deep access**, because access may require searches deep into the stack.

<div class="alert-example">

This program is written in a syntax that gives it the appearance of a program in a C-based language, but

?> it is not meant to be in any particular language.

Consider the following example skeletal program:

```c
void sub3() {
    int x, z;
    x = u + v;
}

void sub2() {
    int w, x;
}

void sub1() {
    int v, w;
}

void main() {
    int v, u;
}
```

<div class="stepper">

Suppose the following sequence of function calls occurs:

- <div>

    `main` calls `sub1`

  </div>

- <div>

    `sub1` calls `sub1`

  </div>

- <div>

    `sub1` calls `sub2`

  </div>

- <div>

    `sub2` calls `sub3`

  </div>

</div>

Figure 10.11 shows the stack during the execution of function `sub3` after this calling sequence.

?> Notice that the activation record instances do not have static links, which would serve no purpose in a dynamic-scoped language.

Consider the references to the variables `x`, `u`, and `v` in function `sub3`.

- The reference to `x` is found in the activation record instance for `sub3`.
- The reference to `u` is found by searching *all* of the activation record instances on the stack, because the only existing variable with that name is in `main`. This search involves following four dynamic links and examining 10 variable names.
- The reference to `v` is found in the most recent (nearest on the dynamic chain) activation record instance for the subprogram `sub1`.

</div>

***Differences Between Deep-Access and Static-Chain***

There are two important differences between the deep-access method for nonlocal access in a *dynamic-scoped language* and the static-chain method for *static-scoped languages*.

- First, in a dynamic-scoped language, there is no way to determine at compile time the length of the chain that must be searched.
    - Every activation record instance in the chain must be searched until the first instance of the variable is found.
    - This is one reason why dynamic-scoped languages typically have slower execution speeds than static-scoped languages.
- Second, activation records must store the names of variables for the search process, whereas in static-scoped language implementations only the values are required. (Names are not required for static scoping, because all variables are represented by the chain_offset/local_offset pairs.)

## Shallow Access

Shallow access is an alternative implementation method, not an alternative semantics. As stated previously, the semantics of deep access and shallow access are identical.

In the shallow-access method, variables declared in subprograms are *not stored in the activation records* of those subprograms. Because with dynamic scoping there is at most one visible version of a variable of any specific name at a given time, a very different approach can be taken.

### Implementation: Separate Stack

One variation of shallow access is to have a separate stack for each variable name in a complete program.

- Every time a new variable with a particular name is created by a declaration at the beginning of a subprogram that has been called, the variable is given a cell at the top of the stack for its name.
- Every reference to the name is to the variable on top of the stack associated with that name, because the top one is the most recently created.
- When a subprogram terminates, the lifetimes of its local variables end, and the stacks for those variable names are popped.
- This method allows fast references to variables, but maintaining the stacks at the entrances and exits of subprograms is costly.

Figure 10.12 shows the variable stacks for the earlier example program in the same situation as shown with the stack in Figure 10.11.

### Implementation: Central Table

Another option for implementing shallow access is to

- use a central table that has a location for each different variable name in a program.
- Along with each entry, a *bit* called **active** is maintained that indicates whether the name has a current binding or variable association.
- Any access to any variable can then be to an offset into the central table. The offset is static, so the access can be fast.

<div class="alert-example">

SNOBOL implementations use the central table implementation technique.

</div>

***Maintenance***

Maintenance of a central table is straightforward.

- A subprogram call requires that all of its local variables be logically placed in the central table.
- If the position of the new variable in the central table is already active—that is, if it contains a variable whose lifetime has not yet ended (which is indicated by the active bit)—that value must be saved somewhere during the lifetime of the new variable.
- Whenever a variable begins its lifetime, the active bit in its central table position must be set.

There have been several variations in the design of the central table and in the way values are stored when they are temporarily replaced.

- One variation is to have a “hidden” stack on which all saved objects are stored. Because subprogram calls and returns, and thus the lifetimes of local variables, are nested, this works well.
- The second variation is perhaps the cleanest and least expensive to implement.
    - A central table of single cells is used, storing only the current version of each variable with a unique name.
    - Replaced variables are stored in the activation record of the subprogram that created the replacement variable.
    - This is a stack mechanism, but it uses the stack that already exists, so the new overhead is minimal.

## Trade-offs Between Shallow and Deep Access

The choice between shallow and deep access to nonlocal variables depends on the relative frequencies of subprogram calls and nonlocal references.

- The deep-access method provides fast subprogram linkage, but references to nonlocals, especially references to distant nonlocals (in terms of the call chain), are costly.
- The shallow-access method provides much faster references to nonlocals, especially distant nonlocals, but is more costly in terms of subprogram linkage.

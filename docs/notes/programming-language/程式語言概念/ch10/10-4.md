!> Because functions cannot be nested in the C-based languages (the only static scope in those languages are those created with blocks), the discussions of this section do not apply to those languages directly.

We do not address the issue of blocks until [Section 10-5][], so in the remainder of this section,

?>  all scopes are assumed to be defined by subprograms.

# Nested Subprograms

Some of the non–C-based static-scoped programming languages use stack-dynamic local variables and allow subprograms to be nested. Among these are Fortran 95 +, Ada, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Swift, as well as the functional languages.

In this section, we examine the most commonly used approach to implementing subprograms that may be nested. Until the very end of this section, we ignore closures.

## The Basics

All nonstatic variables that can be nonlocally accessed are in existing activation record instances and therefore are somewhere in the stack.

***Two-Step Access Process***

<div class="stepper">

A reference to a *nonlocal variable* in a static-scoped language with nested subprograms requires a two-step access process.

- <div>

    The first step of the access process is to *find the instance* of the activation record in the stack in which the variable was allocated.

  </div>

- <div>

    The second part is to *use the local_offset* of the variable (within the activation record instance) to access it.

  </div>

</div>

***Finding the Correct Activation Record Instance***

Finding the correct activation record instance is the more interesting and more difficult of the two steps.

---

- First, note that in a given subprogram, only variables that are declared in *static ancestor scopes* are visible and can be accessed.
- Also, activation record instances of all of the static ancestors are always on the stack when variables in them are referenced by a nested subprogram.

This is guaranteed by the static semantic rules of the static-scoped languages:

- A subprogram is callable only when all of its static ancestor subprograms are active.
- If a particular static ancestor were not active, its local variables would not be bound to storage, so it would be nonsense to allow access to them.

---

The semantics of nonlocal references dictates that <mark>the correct declaration is the first one found when looking through the enclosing scopes, most closely nested first.</mark>

- So, to support nonlocal references, it must be possible to find all of the instances of activation records in the stack that correspond to those static ancestors.
- This observation leads to the implementation approach described in the following subsection.

[Section 10-5]: /notes/programming-language/程式語言概念/ch10/10-5

## Static Chains

?> The most common way to implement static scoping in languages that allow nested subprograms is static chaining.

### Static Link

In this approach, a new pointer, called a static link, is added to the activation record. The **static link**, which is sometimes called a **static scope pointer**, points to the bottom of the activation record instance of an activation of the *static parent*.

- It is used for accesses to nonlocal variables.
- Typically, the static link appears in the activation record below the parameters.

The addition of the static link to the activation record requires that local offsets differ from when the static link is not included.

- Instead of having two activation record elements before the parameters,
- there are now three: the *return address*, the *static link*, and the *dynamic link*.

### Static Chain

A **static chain** is a chain of static links that connect certain activation record instances in the stack.

<div class="alert-example">

During the execution of a subprogram `P`:

- The static link of its activation record instance points to an activation record instance of `P`’s static *parent* program unit.
- That instance’s static link points in turn to `P`’s static *grandparent* program unit’s activation record instance, if there is one.
- So, the static chain connects all the static ancestors of an executing subprogram, in order of static parent first.

This chain can obviously be used to implement the accesses to nonlocal variables in static-scoped languages.

</div>

### Static Depth

Finding the correct activation record instance of a nonlocal variable using static links is relatively straightforward.

- When a reference is made to a nonlocal variable, the activation record instance containing the variable can be found by searching the static chain until a static ancestor activation record instance is found that contains the variable.
- However, it can be much easier than that. Because the nesting of scopes is known at compile time, <mark>the compiler can determine not only that a reference is nonlocal but also the length of the static chain that must be followed to reach the activation record instance that contains the nonlocal object.</mark>

Let **static_depth** be an integer associated with a static scope that indicates how deeply it is nested in the outermost scope.

<div class="alert-example">

- A program unit that is not nested inside any other unit has a static_depth of 0.
- If subprogram `A` is defined in a nonnested program unit, its static_depth is 1.
- If subprogram `A` contains the definition of a nested subprogram `B`, then `B`’s static_depth is 2.

</div>

### Chain_Offset (Nesting_Depth)

<div class="alert-example">

The length of the static chain needed to reach the correct activation record instance for a nonlocal reference to a variable `X` is exactly the difference between the static_depth of the subprogram containing the reference to `X` and the static_depth of the subprogram containing the declaration for `X`.

</div>

This difference (差) is called the **nesting_depth**, or **chain_offset**, of the reference.

***Actual Reference***

The actual reference can be represented by an ordered pair of integers *(chain_offset, local_offset)*, where chain_offset is the number of links to the correct activation record instance (local_offset is described in [Section 10-3][]).

[Section 10-3]: /notes/programming-language/程式語言概念/ch10/10-3?id=local-offset

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following skeletal Python program:

```python
# Global scope
...
def f1():
    def f2():
        def f3():
            ...
        # end of f3
        ...
    # end of f2
    ...
# end of f1
```

The static_depths of the global scope, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` are 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

- If procedure `f3` references a variable declared in `f1`, the chain_offset of that reference would be 2 (static_depth of `f3` minus the static_depth of `f1`).
- If procedure `f3` references a variable declared in `f2`, the chain_offset of that reference would be 1.

*References to locals* can be handled using the same mechanism, with a chain_offset of 0, but instead of using the static pointer to the activation record instance of the subprogram where the variable was declared as the *base address*, the *EP* is used.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

To illustrate the complete process of nonlocal accesses, consider the following skeletal JavaScript program:

[example-of-figure-10.9](./embed/example-of-figure-10.9.md ':include :type=code js')

<div class="stepper">

The sequence of procedure calls is

- <div>

    `main` calls `bigSub`

  </div>

- <div>

    `bigSub` calls `sub2`

  </div>

- <div>

    `sub2` calls `sub3`

  </div>

- <div>

    `sub3` calls `sub1`

  </div>

</div>

The stack situation when execution first arrives at point 1 in this program is shown in Figure 10.9.

![](./img/10.9.jpg ':figure Stack contents at position 1 in the program main.')

At position 1 in procedure `sub1`:

- The reference is to the local variable, `a`, not to the nonlocal variable `a` from `bigSub`. This reference to a has the chain_offset/ local_offset pair (0, 3).

- The reference to `b` is to the nonlocal `b` from `bigSub`. It can be represented by the pair (1, 4). The local_offset is 4, because a 3 offset would be the first local variable (`bigSub` has no parameters).

  !> Notice that if the dynamic link were used to do a simple search for an activation record instance with a declaration for the variable `b`, it would find the variable `b` declared in `sub2`, which would be incorrect.

  !> If the (1, 4) pair were used with the dynamic chain, the variable `e` from `sub3` would be used.

  ?> The static link, however, points to the activation record for `bigSub`, which has the correct version of `b`.

    The variable `b` in `sub2` is not in the referencing environment at this point and is (correctly) not accessible.

- The reference to `c` at point 1 is to the `c` defined in `bigSub`, which is represented by the pair (1, 5).

---

After `sub1` completes its execution, the activation record instance for `sub1` is removed from the stack, and control returns to `sub3`.

- The reference to the variable `e` at position 2 in `sub3` is local and uses the pair (0, 4) for access.
- The reference to the variable `b` is to the one declared in `sub2`, because that is the nearest static ancestor that contains such a declaration. It is accessed with the pair (1, 4). The local_offset is 4 because `b` is the first variable declared in `sub1`, and `sub2` has one parameter.
- The reference to the variable `a` is to the `a` declared in `bigSub`, because neither `sub3` nor its static parent `sub2` has a declaration for a variable named a. It is referenced with the pair (2, 3).

---

After `sub3` completes its execution, the activation record instance for `sub3` is removed from the stack, leaving only the activation record instances for `main`, `bigSub`, and `sub2`.

At position 3 in `sub2`:

- The reference to the variable `a` is to the `a` in `bigSub`, which has the only declaration of `a` among the active routines. This access is made with the pair (1, 3).
- At this position, there is no visible scope containing a declaration for the variable `d`, so this reference to `d` is a static semantics error. The error would be detected when the compiler attempted to compute the chain_offset/local_offset pair.
- The reference to `e` is to the local `e` in `sub2`, which can be accessed with the pair (0, 5).

---

In summary, the references to the variable `a` at points 1, 2, and 3 would be
represented by the following points:

- `a` at points 1: (0, 3) (local)
- `a` at points 2: (2, 3) (two levels away)
- `a` at points 3: (1, 3) (one level away)

</div>

### Maintaining the Static Chain

It is reasonable at this point to ask how the static chain is maintained during program execution.

- If its maintenance is too complex, the fact that it is simple and effective would be unimportant.
- We assume here that parameters that are subprograms are not implemented.

The static chain must be modified for each subprogram call and return.

***Return Part***

The return part is trivial:

- When the subprogram terminates, its activation record instance is removed from the stack.
- After this removal, the new top activation record instance is that of the unit that called the subprogram whose execution just terminated.
- Because the static chain from this activation record instance was never changed, it works correctly just as it did before the call to the other subprogram. Therefore, no other action is required.

***Call Part***

The action required at a subprogram call is more complex.

Although the correct parent scope is easily determined at compile time, the most recent activation record instance of the parent scope must be found at the time of the call.

- <del>This can be done by looking at activation record instances on the dynamic chain until the first one of the parent scope is found.</del>

- However, this search can be avoided by

  ?> treating subprogram declarations and references exactly like variable declarations and references.

    - When the compiler encounters a subprogram call, among other things, it determines the subprogram that declared the called subprogram, which must be a static ancestor of the calling routine.
    - It then computes the nesting_depth, or number of enclosing scopes between the caller and the subprogram that declared the called subprogram. This information is stored and can be accessed by the subprogram call during execution.

At the time of the call,

- the static link of the called subprogram’s activation record instance is found by moving down the static chain of the caller.
- The number of links in this move is equal to the nesting_depth, which was computed at compile time.

<div class="alert-example">

?> `sub1` 的 static link 設定過程 (以 `sub3` 呼叫 `sub1` 為例)。

Consider again the program `main` and the stack situation shown in Figure 10.9.

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:Code -->

[example-of-figure-10.9](./embed/example-of-figure-10.9.md ':include :type=code js')

![](./img/10.9.jpg ':figure Stack contents at position 1 in the program main.')

<!-- tabs:end -->

- At the call to `sub1` in `sub3`, the compiler determines the nesting_depth of `sub3` (the caller) to be two levels inside the procedure that declared the called procedure `sub1`, which is `bigSub`.
- When the call to `sub1` in `sub3` is executed, this information is used to set the static link of the activation record instance for `sub1`.

This static link is set to point to the activation record instance that is pointed to by the second static link in the static chain from the caller’s activation record instance. In this case,

- the caller is `sub3`, whose static link points to its parent’s activation record instance (that of `sub2`).
- The static link of the activation record instance for `sub2` points to the activation record instance for `bigSub`.
- So, the static link for the new activation record instance for `sub1` is set to point to the activation record instance for `bigSub`.

</div>

<div class="alert-attention">

This method works for all subprogram linkage, except when parameters that are subprograms are involved.

</div>

### Criticism

One criticism of using the static chain approach to access nonlocal variables is that references to variables in scopes beyond the static parent cost more than references to locals.

- The static chain must be followed, one link per enclosing scope from the reference to the declaration.
- Fortunately, in practice, references to distant nonlocal variables are rare, so this is not a serious problem.

---

Another criticism of the static-chain approach is that it is difficult for a programmer working on a time-critical program to estimate the costs of nonlocal references,

- because the cost of each reference depends on the depth of nesting between the reference and the scope of declaration.
- Further complicating this problem is that subsequent code modifications may change nesting depths, thereby changing the timing of some references, both in the changed code and possibly in code far from the changes.

### Alternative: Display

Some alternatives to static chains have been developed, most notably an approach that uses an auxiliary data structure called a **display**.

?> However, *none* of the alternatives has been found to be superior to the static-chain method, which is still the most widely used approach. Therefore, none of the alternatives are discussed here.

### Challenges

The processes and data structures described in this section correctly implement closures in languages that do not permit functions to return functions and do not allow functions to be assigned to variables.

However, they are inadequate for languages that do allow one or both of those operations.

Several new mechanisms are needed to implement access to nonlocals in such languages.

- First, if a subprogram accesses a variable from a nesting but not global scope, that variable cannot be stored only in the activation record of its home scope.

    - That activation record could be deallocated before the subprogram that needs it is activated.
    - Such variables could also be stored in the heap and given unlimited extend (their lifetimes are the lifetime of the whole program).

- Second, subprograms must have mechanisms to access the nonlocals that are stored in the heap.

- Third, the heap-allocated variables that are nonlocally accessed must be updated every time their stack versions are updated. Clearly, these are nontrivial extensions to the implementation static scoping using static chains.

# Blocks

Recall from Chapter 5, that a number of languages, including the C-based languages, provide for user-specified local scopes for variables called **blocks**.

<div class="alert-example">

As an example of a block, consider the following code segment:

```c
{
    int temp;
    temp = list[upper];
    list[upper] = list[lower];
    list[lower] = temp;
}
```

A block is specified in the C-based languages as a compound statement that begins with one or more data definitions.

The lifetime of the variable `temp` in the preceding block begins when control enters the block and ends when control exits the block.

The advantage of using such a local is that it cannot interfere with any other variable with the same name that is declared elsewhere in the program, or more specifically, in the referencing environment of the block.

***Implemented via Static Chain***

Blocks can be implemented by using the static-chain process described in [Section 10-4][] for implementing nested subprograms.

- Blocks are treated as parameterless subprograms that are always called from the same place in the program.
- Therefore, every block has an activation record.
- An instance of its activation record is created every time the block is executed.

***Efficient Implementation of Block***

Blocks can also be implemented in a different and somewhat simpler and more efficient way.

- The maximum amount of storage required for block variables at any time during the execution of a program can be statically determined, because blocks are entered and exited in strictly textual order.
- This amount of space can be allocated after the local variables in the activation record.
- Offsets for all block variables can be statically computed, so block variables can be addressed exactly as if they were local variables.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following skeletal program:

```c
void main() {
    int x, y, z;

    while ( ... ) {
        int a, b, c;

        while ( ... ) {
            int d, e;
        }
    }

    while ( ... ) {
        int f, g;
    }
}
```

For this program, the static-memory layout shown in Figure 10.10 could be used.

Note that `f` and `g` occupy the same memory locations as a and `b`, because `a` and `b` are popped off the stack when their block is exited (before `f` and `g` are allocated).

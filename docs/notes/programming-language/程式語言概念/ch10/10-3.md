# Implementing Subprograms with Stack-Dynamic Local Variables

We now examine the implementation of the subprogram linkage in languages in
which locals are stack dynamic, again focusing on the call and return operations.

One of the most important advantages of stack-dynamic local variables
is support for recursion. Therefore, languages that use stack-dynamic local
variables also support recursion.

A discussion of the additional complexity required when subprograms can
be nested is postponed until [Section 10-4][].

## More Complex Activation Records

Subprogram linkage in languages that use stack-dynamic local variables are
more complex than the linkage of simple subprograms for the following reasons:

- The compiler must generate code to cause the implicit allocation and deallocation of local variables.
- Recursion adds the possibility of multiple simultaneous activations of a subprogram:

    which means that there can be more than one instance (incomplete execution) of a subprogram at a given time, with at least one call from outside the subprogram and one or more recursive calls.

    The number of activations is limited only by the memory size of the machine. Each activation requires its own activation record instance.

***Its Format Is Static; Size May Be Dynamic***

- The format of an activation record for a given subprogram in most languages is known at compile time. In many cases, the size is also known for activation records because all local data are of a fixed size.
- That is not the case in some other languages, such as Ada, in which the size of a local array can depend on the value of an actual parameter. In those cases, the format is static, but the size can be dynamic.

## Activation Record Instances

***Create Instance Dynamically on Subprogram Call***

In languages with stack-dynamic local variables, activation record instances must be created dynamically.

![](./img/10.3.jpg ':figure :size=50% A typical activation record for a language with stack-dynamic local variables.')

Because the return address, dynamic link, and parameters are placed in the activation record instance by the caller, these entries must appear first.

### Return Address

The return address usually consists of a pointer to the instruction following the call in the code segment of the calling program unit.

The return address usually consists of a pointer. This pointer specifies the location of the instruction that comes right after the call, and this instruction is in the code segment of the program unit that initiated the call.

### Dynamic Link

The **dynamic link** is a pointer to the base (起始位置) of the activation record instance of the caller.

- In static-scoped languages, this link is used to provide *traceback information* when a run-time error occurs.
- In dynamic-scoped languages, the dynamic link is used to access nonlocal variables. The actual parameters in the activation record are the values or addresses provided by the caller.

### Local Variables

- Local scalar variables are bound to storage within an activation record instance.
- Local variables that are structures are sometimes allocated elsewhere, and only their descriptors and a pointer to that storage are part of the activation record.

Local variables are allocated and possibly initialized in the called subprogram, so they appear last.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following skeletal C function:

```c
void sub(float total, int part) {
    int list[5];
    float sum;
    ...
}
```

![](./img/10.4.jpg ':figure The activation record for function sub.')

</div>

### Run-Time Stack

Activating a subprogram requires the dynamic creation of an instance of the activation record for the subprogram.

- As stated earlier, the format of the activation record is fixed at compile time, although its size may depend on the call in some languages.

- Because the call and return semantics specify that the subprogram last called is the first to complete (*LIFO*), it is reasonable to create instances of these activation records on a stack.

    This stack is part of the runtime system and therefore is called the **run-time stack**, although we will usually just refer to it as the stack.

- Every subprogram activation, whether recursive or nonrecursive, creates a *new instance* of an activation record on the stack. This provides the required *separate copies* of the parameters, local variables, and return address.

### Environment Pointer

One more thing is required to control the execution of a subprogram—the EP (environment pointer).

- Initially, the EP points at the base, or first address of the activation record instance of the main program.
- The run-time system must ensure that <mark>it always points at the base of the activation record instance of the *currently* executing program unit.</mark>

Note that the EP currently being used is not stored in the run-time stack. Only saved versions are stored in the activation record instances as the dynamic links.

***When a Subprogram Is Called***

<div class="stepper">

- The current EP is saved in the new activation record instance as the dynamic link.
- The EP is then set to point at the base of the new activation record instance.

</div>

?> 被呼叫的新副程式會建立實例，並把 dynamic link 設為呼叫者副程式實例的起始位置，也就是目前 EP 指向的位置。接著 EP 再指向被呼叫的新副程式實例的起始位置。

***Upon Return From the Subprogram***

<div class="stepper">

- The stack top is set to the value of the current EP minus one.
- The EP is set to the dynamic link from the activation record instance of the subprogram that has completed its execution.
- Resetting the stack top effectively removes the top activation record instance.

</div>

***Offset Addressing***

The EP is used as the base of the offset addressing of the data contents of the activation record instance—parameters and local variables.

### Revised Semantic Call and Return

***Revised Semantic Call Actions***

We have now discussed several new actions in the linkage process. The lists given in Section 10-2 must be revised to take these into account. Using the activation record form given in this section, the new actions are as follows:

<div class="stepper">

The caller actions are as follows:

- Create an activation record instance.
- Save the execution status of the current program unit.
- Compute and pass the parameters.
- Pass the return address to the called.
- Transfer control to the called.

</div>

***Revised Semantic Return Actions***

<div class="stepper">

The *prologue* actions of the called are as follows:

- Save the old EP in the stack as the dynamic link and create the new value.
- Allocate local variables.

</div>

<div class="stepper">

The *epilogue* actions of the called are as follows:

- If there are pass-by-value-result or out-mode parameters, the current values of those parameters are moved to the corresponding actual parameters.
- If the subprogram is a function, the functional value is moved to a place accessible to the caller.
- Restore the stack pointer by setting it to the value of the current EP minus one and set the EP to the old dynamic link.
- Restore the execution status of the caller.
- Transfer control back to the caller.

</div>

### Lifecycle

Recall from Chapter 9, that a subprogram is active from the time it is called until the time that execution is completed.

- At the time it becomes inactive, its local scope ceases to exist and its referencing environment is no longer meaningful.
- Therefore, at that time, its activation record instance can be destroyed.

### Passing Parameters: Stack vs. Registers

Parameters are not always transferred in the stack.

- In many compilers for RISC machines, parameters are passed in *registers*. This is because RISC machines normally have many more registers than CISC machines.
- In the remainder of this chapter, however, we assume that parameters are passed in the *stack*. It is straightforward to modify this approach for parameters being passed in registers.

## An Example without Recursion

Note that some implementations do not actually use an activation record instance on the stack for `main` functions, such as the one shown in the figure. However, it can be done this way, and it simplifies both the implementation and our discussion.

In this example and in all others in this chapter, we assume that the stack grows from lower addresses to higher addresses, although in a particular implementation, the stack may grow in the opposite direction.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following skeletal C program:

```c
void fun1(float r) {
    int s, t;
    ... <---------- 1
    fun2(s);
    ...
}

void fun2(int x) {
    int y;
    ... <---------- 2
    fun3(y);
    ...
}

void fun3(int q) {
    ... <---------- 3
}

void main() {
    float p;
    ...
    fun1(p);
    ...
}
```

The sequence of function calls in this program is

1. `main` calls `fun1`
2. `fun1` calls `fun2`
3. `fun2` calls `fun3`

The stack contents for the points labeled 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Figure 10.5.

![](./img/10.5.jpg ':figure Stack contents for three points in a program.')

- At point 1, only the activation record instances for function `main` and function `fun1` are on the stack.
- When `fun1` calls `fun2`, an instance of `fun2`’s activation record is created on the stack.
- When `fun2` calls `fun3`, an instance of `fun3`’s activation record is created on the stack.

---

- When `fun3`’s execution ends, the instance of its activation record is removed from the stack, and the EP is used to reset the stack top pointer.
- Similar processes take place when functions `fun2` and `fun1` terminate.
- After the return from the call to `fun1` from main, the stack has only the instance of the activation record of `main`.

</div>

### Dynamic Chain

The collection of dynamic links present in the stack at a given time is called the **dynamic chain**, or **call chain**. It represents the dynamic history of how execution got to its current position, which is always in the subprogram code whose activation record instance is on top of the stack.

### Local Offset

References to local variables can be represented in the code as offsets from the beginning of the activation record of the local scope, whose address is stored in the EP. Such an offset is called a **local_offset**.

The local_offset of a variable in an activation record can be determined at compile time, using the order, types, and sizes of variables declared in the subprogram associated with the activation record.

To simplify the discussion, we assume that all variables take one position in the activation record.

- The first local variable declared in a subprogram would be allocated in the activation record two positions plus the number of parameters from the bottom (the first two positions are for the return address and the dynamic link).
- The second local variable declared would be one position nearer the stack top and so forth.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the preceding example program.

- In `fun1`, the local_offset of `s` is 3; for `t` it is 4.
- Likewise, in `fun2`, the local_offset of `y` is 3.

To get the address of any local variable, the local_offset of the variable is added to the EP

</div>

## Recursion

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following example C program, which uses recursion to compute the factorial function:

```c
int factorial(int n) {
        <---------- 1
    if (n <= 1)
        return 1;
    else
        return (n * factorial(n - 1));
        <---------- 2
}
void main() {
    int value;
    value = factorial(3);
        <---------- 3
}
```

The activation record format for the function `factorial` is shown in Figure 10.6.

![](./img/10.6.jpg ':figure :size=35% The activation record for factorial.')

Notice that it has an additional entry (Functional value) for the return value of the function.

---

Figure 10.7 shows the contents of the stack for the three times execution reaches position 1 in the function `factorial`.

![](./img/10.7.jpg ':figure Stack contents at position 1 in factorial.')

- Each shows one more activation of the function, with its functional value undefined.
- The first activation record instance has the return address to the calling function, `main`.
- The others have a return address to the function itself; these are for the recursive calls.

---

Figure 10.8 shows the stack contents for the three times that execution reaches position 2 in the function `factorial`.

- Position 2 is meant to be the time after the `return` is executed but before the activation record has been removed from the stack.

![](./img/10.8.jpg ':figure Stack contents during execution of main and factorial.')

Recall that the code for the function multiplies the current value of the parameter `n` by the value returned by the recursive call to the function.

- The first return from `factorial` returns the value 1 (base case). The activation record instance for that activation has a value of 1 for its version of the parameter `n`.
- The result, 1, is returned to the second activation of `factorial` to be multiplied by its parameter value for `n`, which is 2.
- This step returns the value 2 to the first activation of `factorial` to be multiplied by its parameter value for `n`, which is 3, yielding the final functional value of 6, which is then returned to the first call to `factorial` in `main`.

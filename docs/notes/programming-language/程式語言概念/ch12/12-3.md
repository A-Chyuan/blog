# Design Issues for Object-Oriented Languages

A number of issues must be considered when designing the programming language features to support inheritance and dynamic binding.

## The Exclusivity of Objects

***完全使用物件模型來設計語言***

A language designer who is totally committed to the object model of computation designs an object system that subsumes all other concepts of type.

- <mark>Everything</mark>, from a simple scalar integer to a complete software system, <mark>is an object</mark> in this mind-set.
- The advantage of this choice is the elegance and pure uniformity of the language and its use.
- The primary disadvantage is that simple operations must be done through the *message-passing process*, which often makes them <mark>slower than similar operations in an imperative model</mark>, where single machine instructions may implement such simple operations.
    - In this purest model of object-oriented computation, all types are classes.
    - There is no distinction between predefined and user-defined classes.
    - In fact, all classes are treated the same way and all computation is accomplished through message passing.

***在命令式語言的基礎上加入物件導向***

One alternative to the exclusive use of objects that is common in imperative languages to which support for object-oriented programming has been added is the following:

- Retain the complete collection of types from the base imperative language
- Add the object typing model.

This approach results in a larger language whose type structure can be confusing to new users of the language.

---

Another alternative to the exclusive use of objects is to

- have an imperative-style type structure for the primitive scalar types,
- but implement all structured types as objects.

This choice provides the speed of operations on primitive values that is comparable to those expected in the imperative model.

## Are Subclasses Subtypes?

If a language allows programs in which a variable of a class can be substituted for a variable of one of its ancestor classes in any situation, without causing type errors and without changing the behavior of the program, that language supports the **principle of substitution**.

<div class="alert-example">

In such a language:

- If class `B` is derived from class `A`
- `B` has everything `A` has and the behavior of an object of class `B`.
- <mark>When an object of class `B` is used in place of an object of class `A`, the behavior of the object should be identical to that of an object of class `A`.</mark>
- When the above conditions are true, `B` is a **subtype** of `A`.

</div>

Although a subclass that is a subtype of its parent class must expose all of the members that are exposed by its parent class, the subclass can have members that are not in the parent class and still be a subtype.

<div class="alert-example">

The subtypes of Ada are examples of predefined subtypes. For example,

```ada
subtype Small_Int is Integer range -100..100;
```

- Variables of `Small_Int` type have all of the operations of `Integer` variables but can store only a subset of the values possible in `Integer`.
- Furthermore, every `Small_Int` variable can be used anywhere an `Integer` variable can be used.

That is, every `Small_Int` variable is, in a sense, an `Integer` variable.

</div>

***Subclass vs. Subtype***

The definition of subtype clearly disallows having public entities in the parent class that are not public in the subclass. So, the derivation process for subtypes must require that public entities of the parent class are inherited as public entities in the subclass.

Not all subclasses are subtypes and not all subtypes are subclasses.

<div class="alert-example">

- A subclass cannot be a subtype if it changes the behavior of one of its overriding methods.

    (覆寫方法後，就不再符合 principle of substitution 了)

- Also, a class that is not a subclass of another class can be a subtype of that class by defining the same members, in terms of both types and behavior.

    (即使不是繼承自該類別，只要定義了相同的 member，依然可以視為該類別的 subtype)

</div>

<div class="alert-note">

To promote code reuse:

- A subtype inherits interfaces and behavior.
- A subclass inherits implementation.

</div>

Most static-typed languages that support object-oriented programming are designed so that subclasses are subtypes, unless the programmer specifically designs a subclass that has behavior that differs from that of its parent class.

One obvious question is: Is the issue of whether subclasses are subtypes a theoretical or practical one?

- It is probably unusual to define a subclass whose overriding methods preserve the type protocols of their corresponding overridden methods but not their effects. So it is not a frequent practical issue.
- However, requiring all subclasses to be subtypes, if there were a reasonably simple way to enforce that, would place inheritance on a sounder theoretical base.

## Single and Multiple Inheritance

Another simple design issue for object-oriented languages is: Does the language allow multiple inheritance (in addition to single inheritance)?

- Maybe it’s not so simple.
- The purpose of multiple inheritance is to allow a new class to inherit from two or more classes.

Because multiple inheritance is sometimes highly useful, why would a language designer not include it? The reasons lie in two categories: complexity and efficiency.

The additional *complexity* is illustrated by several problems.

<div class="alert-example">

- First, note that if a class has two unrelated parent classes and neither defines a name that is defined in the other, there is no problem.
- However, suppose a subclass named `C` inherits from both class `A` and class `B` and both `A` and `B` define an inheritable method named `display`. If `C` needs to reference both versions of `display`, how can that be done?
- This ambiguity problem is further complicated when the two parent classes both define identically named methods and one or both of them must be overridden in the subclass.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/12.3.jpg ':figure :size=30% An example of diamond inheritance.')

Another issue arises if

- both `A` and `B` are derived from a common parent, `Z`.
- `C` has both `A` and `B` as parent classes.

This situation is called diamond or shared inheritance.

In this case, both `A` and `B` should include `Z`’s inheritable variables.

- Suppose `Z` includes an inheritable variable named `sum`.
- The question is whether `C` should inherit both versions of `sum` or just one, and if just one, which one?
- There may be programming situations in which just one of the two should be inherited, and others in which both should be inherited.

A similar problem occurs when both `A` and `B` inherit a method from `Z` and both override that method. If a client of `C`, which inherits both overriding methods, calls the method, which method is called, or are both supposed to be called.

</div>

The question of *efficiency* may be more perceived than real.

<div class="alert-example">

In C++, Supporting multiple inheritance requires just one additional array access and one extra addition operation for each dynamically bound method call, at least with some machine architectures.

Although this operation is required even if the program does not use multiple inheritance, it is a small additional cost.

</div>

The use of multiple inheritance can easily lead to complex program organizations.

- Many who have attempted to use multiple inheritance have found that designing the classes to be used as multiple parents is difficult.
- And the difficulties are not restricted to those created by the initial developer. A class might be used by another developer at some later date as one of the parents of a new class.
- Maintenance of systems that use multiple inheritance can be a more serious problem, for multiple inheritance leads to more complex dependencies among classes.

It is not clear to some that the benefits of multiple inheritance are worth the added effort to design and maintain a system that uses it.

***An Alternative: Interface***

An interface is somewhat similar to an abstract class; its methods are declared but not defined.

- Interfaces cannot be instantiated.
- They are used as an alternative to multiple inheritance.
- Interfaces provide some of the benefits of multiple inheritance but have fewer disadvantages.

  <div class="alert-example">

    The problems of diamond inheritance are avoided when interfaces, rather than multiple inheritance, are used.

  </div>

## Allocation and Deallocation of Objects

There are two design questions concerning the allocation and deallocation of objects.

***Allocation***

The first of these is the place from which objects are allocated.

- If they behave like the abstract data types, then they can be allocated from anywhere. This means they
    - could be allocated from the run-time stack
    - or explicitly created on the heap with an operator or function, such as `new`.

If they are all *heap dynamic*, there is the advantage of

- having a uniform method of creation and access through pointer or reference variables.
- This design simplifies the assignment operation for objects, making it in all cases only a pointer or reference value change.
- It also allows references to objects to be implicitly dereferenced, simplifying the access syntax.

If objects are *stack dynamic*, there is a potential problem with regard to subtypes.

<div class="alert-example">

- Class `B` is a child of class `A`.
- `B` is a subtype of `A`, then an object of `B` type can be assigned to a variable of `A` type.

For example, if `b1` is a variable of `B` type and `a1` is a variable of `A` type, then

```cpp
a1 = b1;
```

is a legal statement.

---

If `a1` and `b1` are references to *heap-dynamic* objects, there is no problem—the assignment is a simple pointer assignment.

---

However, if `a1` and `b1` are *stack dynamic*, then they are value variables and, if assigned the value of the object, must be copied to the space of the target object.

- If `B` adds a data field to what it inherited from `A`, then `a1` will not have sufficient space on the stack for all of `b1`.
- The excess will simply be *truncated*, which could be confusing to programmers who write or use the code. This truncation is called **object slicing**.

The following example and Figure 12.4 illustrate the problem.

```cpp
class A {
    int x;
    ...
};
class B : A {
    int y;
    ...
}
```

![](./img/12.4.jpg ':figure :size=30% An example of object slicing.')

</div>

***Deallocation***

The second question here is concerned with those cases where objects are allocated from the heap. The question is whether deallocation is implicit, explicit, or both.

- If deallocation is implicit, some implicit method of storage reclamation is required.
- If deallocation can be explicit, that raises the issue of whether dangling pointers or references can be created.

## Dynamic and Static Binding

As discussed in [Section 12.2.3][], dynamic binding of messages to methods is an essential part of object-oriented programming.

The question here is whether all bindings of messages to methods are dynamic.

- The alternative is to allow the user to specify whether a specific binding is to be dynamic or static.
- The advantage of this is that static bindings are faster.
- So, if a binding need not be dynamic, why pay the price?

## Nested Classes

One of the primary motivations for nesting class definitions is information hiding.

If a new class is needed by only one class,

- there is no reason to define it so it can be seen by other classes.
- In this situation, the new class can be nested inside the class that uses it.
- In some cases, the new class is nested inside a subprogram, rather than directly in another class.

The class in which the new class is nested is called the **nesting class**.

The most obvious design issues associated with class nesting are related to visibility.

- Specifically, one issue is: Which of the members of the nesting class are visible in the nested class?
- The other important issue is the opposite: Which of the members of the nested class are visible in the nesting class?

## Initialization of Objects

The initialization issue is whether and how objects are initialized to values when they are created. This is more complicated than may be first thought.

One question is whether objects must be initialized manually or through some implicit mechanism. When an object of a subclass is created, is the associated initialization of the inherited parent class member implicit or must the programmer explicitly deal with it?

# Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction

A language that is **object oriented** must provide support for three key language features:

- Abstract data types ([Chapter 11][])
- **Inheritance**
- **Dynamic binding** of method calls to methods.

[Chapter 11]: /notes/programming-language/程式語言概念/ch11/1-1

This chapter focuses on inheritance and dynamic binding.

## Inheritance

One of the most promising opportunities for increased productivity is software *reuse*. Abstract data types, with their encapsulation and access controls, are obvious candidates for reuse.

***Problem With the Reuse of ADT***

In nearly all cases, the features and capabilities of the existing type are not quite right for the new use.

- The old type requires at least some minor modifications. Such modifications can be difficult, because they require the person doing the modification to understand part of the existing code.
- In many cases, the person doing the modification is not the program’s original author. Furthermore, the modifications often require changes to all client programs.

The type definitions are all independent and are at the same level.

- This design often makes it impossible to organize a program to match the problem space being addressed by the program. (現有的 ADT 無法完全反映真實世界問題)
- In many cases, the underlying problem has categories of objects that are related, both as siblings (being similar to each other) and as parents and children (having a descendant relationship).

***Solving Reuse With Inheritance***

Inheritance offers a solution to both the modification problem posed by abstract data type reuse and the program organization problem.

- If a new abstract data type can inherit the data and functionality of some existing type, and is also allowed to modify some of those entities and add new entities, reuse is greatly facilitated without requiring changes to the reused abstract data type.
- Programmers can begin with an existing abstract data type and design a modified descendant of it to fit a new problem requirement.
- Furthermore, inheritance provides a framework for the definition of hierarchies of related classes that can reflect the descendant relationships in the problem space.

***ADT in OOP***

The abstract data types in object-oriented languages are usually called **classes**. As with instances of abstract  ata types, *class instances* are called **objects**.

- A class that is defined through inheritance from another class is a **derived class**, a **subclass**, or a **child class**.
- A class from which the new class is derived is its **base class**, **superclass**, or **parent class**.

---

The subprograms that define the operations on objects of a class are called **methods**.

- The calls to methods are sometimes called **messages**.
- The entire collection of methods of a class is called the **message protocol**, or **message interface**, of the class.
- Computations in an object-oriented program are specified by messages sent from objects to other objects, or in some cases, to classes.

Methods are similar to subprograms. Both are collections of code that perform some computation. Both can take parameters and return results.

***Calling a Subprogram vs. Passing a Message***

Calling a subprogram (處理外部資料):

- A subprogram typically processes data that is either passed to it by its caller as a parameter or is accessed nonlocally or globally.
- A subprogram defines a process that it can perform on *any data* sent to it (or made available nonlocally or globally).

Passing a message (聚焦於物件內部):

- A message that is sent to an object is a request to execute one of its methods.
- At least some of the data on which the method is to operate is part of the object itself.
- Objects have methods that define processes the object can perform on itself.
- Because the objects are of abstract data types, these should be the only ways to manipulate data of the object.

***Simple Example of Inheritance***

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following:

- Suppose we have a class named `Vehicles`, which has variables for year, color, and make.
- A natural specialization, or subclass, of this would be `Truck`, which could inherit the variables from `Vehicle`, but would add variables for hauling capacity and number of wheels.

Figure 12.1 shows a simple diagram to indicate the relationship between the `Vehicle` class and the `Truck` class, in which the arrow points to the parent class.

</div>

***Differences Between a Parent Class and Its Subclasses***

There are several ways a derived class can differ from its parent.

1. The subclass can add variables and/or methods to those inherited from the parent class.
2. The subclass can modify the behavior of one or more of its inherited methods. A modified method has the same name, and often the same protocol, as the one of which it is a modification.
3. The parent class can define some of its variables or methods to have private access, which means they will not be visible in the subclass.

The new method is said to **override** the inherited method, which is then called an **overridden method**. The purpose of an overriding method is to provide an operation in the subclass that is similar to one in the parent class, but is customized for objects of the subclass.

<div class="alert-example">

- A parent class, `Bird`, might have a `draw` method that draws a generic bird.
- A subclass of `Bird` named `Waterfowl` could override the `draw` method inherited from `Bird` to draw a generic waterfowl, perhaps a duck.

</div>

***Instance vs. Class Methods and Variables***

Classes can have two kinds of methods and two kinds of variables (instance vs. class).

The most commonly used methods and variables are called **instance methods** and **instance variables**.

- Every object of a class has its own set of instance variables, which store the object’s state.

- The only difference between two objects of the same class is the state of their instance variables.

    <div class="alert-example">

    A class for cars might have instance variables for color, make, model, and year.

    </div>

- Instance methods operate only on the objects of the class.

**Class variables** <mark>belong to the class, rather than their objects</mark>, so there is only one copy for the class.

<div class="alert-example">

If we wanted to count the number of instances of a class, the counter could not be an instance variable—it would need to be a class variable.

</div>

**Class methods** can perform operations on the class, and possibly also on the objects of the class.

- They can be called by prefixing their names with either the class name or a variable that references one of their instances.
- If a class defines a class method, that method can be called even if there are no instances of the class.
- A class method could be used to create an instance of the class.

***Single vs. Multiple Inheritance***

- If a new class is a subclass of a single parent class, then the derivation process is called **single inheritance**.
- If a class has more than one parent class, the process is called **multiple inheritance**.

![](./img/12.5.jpg ':figure :size=50% Multiple inheritance.')

- When a number of classes are related through single inheritance, their relationships to each other can be shown in a *derivation tree*.
- The class relationships in a multiple inheritance can be shown in a *derivation graph*. This is shown in Figure 12.5 in Section 12.4.2.2.

***Disadvantage***

One disadvantage of inheritance as a means of increasing the possibility of reuse is that it creates dependencies among the classes in an inheritance hierarchy.

- This result works against one of the advantages of abstract data types, which is that they are independent of each other.
- Of course, not all abstract data types must be completely independent. But in general, the independence of abstract data types is one of their strongest positive characteristics.
- However, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to increase the reusability of abstract data types without creating dependencies among some of them.
- Furthermore, in many cases, the dependencies naturally mirror dependencies in the underlying problem space.

***Access Control in Inheritance***

In Chapter 11 the access controls for variables and methods, together often called *members*, in a class are discussed.

- Private members are visible inside the class, while public members also are visible to clients of the class.
- Inheritance brings a new category of possible visibility, subclasses.
- <mark>Private members of a base class are not visible to subclasses</mark>, but public members are.
- The third level of accessibility, protected, allows members of a base class to be visible to subclasses, but not clients.

## Dynamic Binding

The third essential characteristic (after abstract data types and inheritance) of object-oriented programming languages is a kind of *polymorphism* provided by the dynamic binding of messages to method definitions. This is sometimes called **dynamic dispatch**.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following situation:

- There is a base class, `A`, that defines a method `draw` that draws some figure associated with the base class.
- A second class, `B`, is defined as a subclass of `A`. Objects of this new class also need a `draw` method that is like that provided by `A` but a bit different because the subclass objects are slightly different.

So, the subclass overrides the inherited `draw` method. If a client of `A` and `B` has a variable that is a reference to class `A`’s objects, that reference also could point at class `B`’s objects, making it a **polymorphic** reference.

If the method `draw`, which is defined in both classes, is called through the polymorphic reference, the run-time system must determine, during execution, which method should be called, `A`’s or `B`’s (by determining which type object is currently referenced by the reference). Figure 12.2 shows this situation.

![](./img/12.2.jpg ':figure Dynamic binding.')

?> 依據當前參考的物件型別，動態決定要呼叫 base class `A` 的 `draw` method，還是 subclass `B` 的 `draw` method。

</div>

Polymorphism is a natural part of any object-oriented language that is
statically typed. In a sense, polymorphism makes a statically typed language a
little bit dynamically typed, where the little bit is in some bindings of method
calls to methods. The type of a polymorphic variable is indeed dynamic.

One purpose of dynamic binding is to allow software systems to be more easily extended during both development and maintenance.

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose we have a catalog of used cars that is implemented as a `Car` class and a subclass for each car in the catalog.

- The subclasses contain an image of the car and specific information about the car.
- Users can browse the cars with a program that displays the images and information about each car as the user browses to it.
- The display of each car (and its information) includes a button that the user can click if he or she is interested in that particular car.
- After the user gets through the catalog, the system will print the images and information about the cars of interest to the user.

One way to implement this system is to place a reference to each car (subclass of `Car`) of interest in a list that can store references to the base class, `Car`. When the user is ready, information about all of the cars of interest could be printed for the user to study and compare the cars in the list. The catalog of cars will of course change frequently. This will necessitate corresponding changes in the subclasses of `Car`. However, changes to the collection of subclasses will not require any other changes to the system.

```java
public class Car {
    ...
    public void displayInfo() { ... }
}

class Sedan extends Car {
    ...
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo();
        // display more info of Sedan
    }
}

class Truck extends Car {
    ...
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo();
        // display more info of Truck
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Car> interestedCars = new ArrayList<>();
    Car car1 = new Sedan("...");
    Car car2 = new Truck("...");
    for (Car car : interestedCars) {
        // Dynamic binding
        car.displayInfo(); // 根據實際物件的型別（Sedan 或 Truck）來呼叫正確的 displayInfo()
    }
}
```

</div>

***Abstract Class and Method***

In some cases, the design of an inheritance hierarchy results in one or more classes that are so high in the hierarchy that an instantiation of them would not make sense.

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose a program defined a `Building` class and a collection of subclasses for specific types of buildings, for instance, `French_Gothic_Cathedrals`.

- It probably would not make sense to have an implemented `draw` method in `Building`.
- But because all of its descendant classes should have such methods, the protocol (but not the body) of that method is included in `Building`.

Such a method is often called an **abstract method** (*pure virtual method* in C++).

A class that includes at least one abstract method is called an **abstract class** (*abstract base class* in C++).  

- Such a class usually cannot be instantiated, because some of <mark>its methods are declared but are not defined</mark> (they do not have bodies).
- Any subclass of an abstract class that is to be instantiated must provide implementations (definitions) of all of the inherited abstract methods.

</div>

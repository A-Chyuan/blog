# Implementation of Object-Oriented Constructs

There are at least two parts of language support for object-oriented programming that pose interesting questions for language implementers:

- Storage structures for instance variables.
- The dynamic bindings of messages to methods.

## Instance Data Storage

In C++, classes are defined as extensions of C’s record structures—structs. This similarity suggests a storage structure for the instance variables of class instances—that of a record.

This form of this structure is called a **class instance record (CIR)**.

- The structure of a CIR is static, so it is built at compile time and used as a template for the creation of the data of class instances.
- Every class has its own CIR. When a derivation takes place, the CIR for the subclass is a copy of that of the parent class, with entries for the new instance variables added at the end.

Because the structure of the CIR is static, access to all instance variables can be done as it is in records, using *constant offsets* from the beginning of the CIR instance. This makes these accesses as efficient as those for the fields of records.

## Dynamic Binding of Method Calls to Methods

- Methods in a class that are statically bound need not be involved in the CIR for the class.
- However, methods that will be dynamically bound must have entries in this structure.

    Such entries could simply have a pointer to the code of the method, which must be set at object creation time.

    - Calls to a method could then be connected to the corresponding code through this pointer in the CIR.
    - The drawback to this technique is that every instance would need to store pointers to all dynamically bound methods that could be called from the instance.

Notice that the list of dynamically bound methods that can be called from an instance of a class is the same for all instances of that class.

- Therefore, the list of such methods must be stored only once.
- So the CIR for an instance needs only a single pointer to that list to enable it to find called methods.
- The storage structure for the list is often called a **virtual method table (vtable)**.

Method calls can be represented as offsets from the beginning of the vtable. Polymorphic variables of an ancestor class always reference the CIR of the correct type object, so getting to the correct version of a dynamically bound method is assured.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following Java example, in which all methods are dynamically bound:

```java
public class A {
    public int a, b;
    public void draw() { ... }
    public int area() { ... }
}

public class B extends A {
    public int c, d;
    public void draw() { ... }
    public void sift() { ... }
}
```

The CIRs for the `A` and `B` classes, along with their vtables, are shown in Figure 12.7.

![](./img/12.7.jpg ':figure An example of the CIRs with single inheritance.')

Notice that the method pointer for the `area` method in B’s vtable points to the code for A’s `area` method.

- The reason is that B does *not override* A’s `area` method, so if a client of B calls `area`, it is the `area` method inherited from A.
- On the other hand, the pointers for `draw` and `sift` in B’s vtable point to B’s `draw` and `sift`. The `draw` method is overridden in B and `sift` is defined as an addition in B.

Multiple inheritance complicates the implementation of dynamic binding.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following three C++ class definitions:

```cpp
class A {
    public:
        int a;
        virtual void fun() { ... }
        virtual void init() { ... }
};

class B {
    public:
        int b;
        virtual void sum() { ... }
};

class C : public A, public B {
    public:
        int c;
        virtual void fun() { ... }
        virtual void dud() { ... }
};
```

- The C class inherits the variable `a` and the `init` method from the A class. It redefines the `fun` method, although both its `fun` and that of the parent class A are potentially visible through a polymorphic variable (of type A).
- From B, C inherits the variable `b` and the `sum` method.
- C defines its own variable, `c`, and defines an uninherited method, `dud`.

A CIR for `C` must include `A`’s data, `B`’s data, and `C`’s data, as well as some means of accessing all visible methods.

- Under single inheritance, the CIR would include a pointer to a vtable that has the addresses of the code of all visible methods.
- With multiple inheritance, however, it is not that simple. There must be at least two different views available in the CIR—one for each of the parent classes, one of which includes the view for the subclass, `C`. This inclusion of the view of the subclass in the parent class’s view is just as in the implementation of single inheritance.

The CIR for `C` is shown in Figure 12.8.

![](./img/12.8.jpg ':figure An example of a subclass CIR with multiple parents.')

There must also be two vtables: one for the `A` and `C` view and one for the `B` view.

- The first part of the CIR for `C` in this case can be the `C` and `A` view, which begins with a vtable pointer for the methods of `C` and those inherited from `A`, and includes the data inherited from `A`.
- Following this in `C`’s CIR is the `B` view part, which begins with a vtable pointer for the virtual methods of `B`, which is followed by the data inherited from `B` and the data defined in `C`.

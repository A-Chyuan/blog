# Implementation Methods

***Machine language***

In most computers,

- *macro*instructions are actually implemented with a set of instructions called **microinstructions**, which are defined at an even lower level.
- Because microinstructions are never seen by software, they will not be discussed further here.

The **machine language** of the computer is its set of instructions. In the absence of other supporting software, its own machine language is the only language that most hardware computers “understand.”

The more practical machine design choice implements in hardware a very *low-level language* that provides

- The most commonly needed primitive operations.
- Requires system software to create an interface to programs in higher-level languages.

<div class="alert-attention">

Theoretically, a computer could be designed and built with a particular *high-level language* as its machine language, but it would be very complex and expensive. Furthermore, it would be highly *inflexible*, because it would be difficult (but not impossible) to use it with other high-level languages.

</div>

***Virtual Computers***

The **operating system** and **language implementations** are layered over the *machine language interface* of a computer. These layers can be thought of as **virtual computers**, providing interfaces to the user at higher levels.

<div class="alert-example">

- An operating system and a C compiler provide a virtual C computer.
- With other compilers, a machine can become other kinds of virtual computers.

</div>

- Most computer systems provide several different virtual computers.
- **User programs** form another layer over the top of the layer of virtual computers.
- The layered view of a computer is shown in Figure 1.2.

![](./img/1.2.jpg ':figure Layered interface of virtual computers, provided by a typical computer system.')

***Operating System***

**Operating system** supplies higher-level primitives than those of the machine language. These primitives provide

- System resource management.
- Input and output operations.
- A file management system.
- Text and/or program editors.
- A variety of other commonly needed functions.

***Language Implementation System***

Because **language implementation systems** need many of the operating system facilities, they interface with the operating system rather than directly with the processor (in machine language).

Intensive research efforts were made to understand and formalize the process of constructing these high-level language implementations.

The greatest success of those efforts was in the area of **syntax analysis**, primarily because that part of the implementation process is an application of parts of *automata theory* and *formal language theory* that were then well understood.

***Von Neumann Bottleneck***

The speed of the *connection* between a computer’s memory and its processor often determines the speed of the computer.

- Because instructions often can be executed faster than they can be moved to the processor for execution.
- This connection is called the **von Neumann bottleneck**; it is the primary limiting factor in the speed of von Neumann architecture computers.
- The von Neumann bottleneck has been one of the primary motivations for the research and development of *parallel* computers.

## Compilation

Programs can be translated into machine language, which can be executed directly on the computer. This method is called a **compiler implementation**:

- Slow translation.
- Fast execution.
- C, COBOL, C++, etc.

The process of compilation and program execution takes place in several phases, the most important of which are shown in Figure 1.3.

![](./img/1.3.jpg ':figure The compilation process.')

- **Lexical analysis**: Converts characters in the source program into lexical units.
- **Syntax analysis**: Transforms lexical units into parse trees which represent the syntactic structure of program.
- **Semantics analysis**: Generate intermediate code.
- **Code generation**: Machine code is generated.

***Source Program***

The language that a compiler translates is called the **source language**.

***Lexical Analyzer***

The **lexical analyzer** gathers the characters of the source program into lexical units. The **lexical units** of a program are

- Identifiers
- Special words
- Operators
- Punctuation symbols

The lexical analyzer ignores comments in the source program because the compiler has no use for them.

***Syntax Analyzer***

- The **syntax analyzer** takes the lexical units from the lexical analyzer and uses them to construct hierarchical structures called **parse trees**. These parse trees represent the syntactic structure of the program.
- In many cases, no actual parse tree structure is constructed; rather, the information that would be required to build a tree is generated and used directly.
- Both lexical units and parse trees are discussed further in Chapter 3.
- Lexical analysis and syntax analysis, or parsing, are discussed in Chapter 4.

***Intermediate Code Generator***

The **intermediate code** generator produces a program in a different language, at an intermediate level between the source program and the final output of the compiler: the machine language program.

- Intermediate languages sometimes look very much like assembly languages, and in fact, sometimes are actual assembly languages.
- In other cases, the intermediate code is at a level somewhat higher than an assembly language.

***Semantic Analyzer***

The **semantic analyzer** is an integral part of the intermediate code generator.

- The semantic analyzer *checks for errors*, such as type errors, that are difficult to detect during syntax analysis.

***Optimization***

**Optimization**:

- Improves programs (usually in their intermediate code version) by making them *smaller* or *faster* or both.
- Because many kinds of optimization are difficult to do on machine language, most optimization is done on the intermediate code.

***Symbol Table***

The **symbol table** serves *as a database* for the compilation process.

- The primary contents of the symbol table are the type and attribute information of each user-defined name in the program.
- This information is placed in the symbol table by the lexical and syntax analyzers and is used by the semantic analyzer and the code generator.

***Code Generator***

The **code generator** translates the optimized intermediate code version of the program into an equivalent *machine language program*.

***Linking and Loading***

Although the machine language generated by a compiler can be executed directly on the hardware, it must nearly <mark>always be run along with some other code.</mark>

- Most user programs also require programs from the operating system, such as input and output.
- The compiler builds calls to required system programs when they are needed by the user program.
- Before the machine language programs produced by a compiler can be executed, the required programs from the operating system must be found and linked to the user program.

***Linking***

The **linking** operation connects the user program to the system programs by placing the addresses of the entry points of the system programs in the calls to them in the user program.

***Load Module (Executable Image)***

The user and system code together are sometimes called a **load module**, or **executable image**.

***Linker***

The process of collecting system programs and linking them to user programs is called linking and loading, or sometimes just linking. It is accomplished by a systems program called a **linker**.

In addition to systems programs, user programs must often be linked to previously compiled programs that reside in libraries. So the linker not only links a given program to system programs, but also it may link it to other user or system-supplied programs.

## Pure Interpretation

Pure interpretation lies at the opposite end (from compilation) among implementation methods.

- Programs are interpreted by another program called an **interpreter**, with no translation whatever.
- The interpreter program acts as a software simulation of a machine whose fetch-execute cycle <mark>deals with high-level language program statements rather than machine instructions.</mark>
- This software simulation obviously provides a virtual machine for the language.

The process of pure interpretation is shown in Figure 1.4.

![](./img/1.4.jpg ':figure :size=30% Pure interpretation.')

***Advantages***

Pure interpretation has the advantage of

- Allowing easy implementation of many source-level debugging operations.
- Because all *run-time error messages* can refer to source-level units.

<div class="alert-example">

If an array index is found to be out of range, the error message can easily indicate the source line of the error and the name of the array.

</div>

***Disadvantages***

On the other hand, this method has the serious disadvantage that

- *Execution* is 10 to 100 times *slower* than in compiled systems.

    The primary source of this slowness is the decoding of the high-level language statements, which are far more complex than machine language instructions (although there may be fewer statements than instructions in equivalent machine code).

- Furthermore, regardless of how many times a statement is executed, it must be *decoded every time*.

    Therefore, *statement decoding*, rather than the connection between the processor and memory, is the *bottleneck* of a pure interpreter.

- It often requires *more space*.

    In addition to the source program, the symbol table must be present during interpretation.

    Furthermore, the source program may be stored in a form designed for easy access and modification rather than one that provides for minimal size.

## Hybrid Implementation Systems

Some language implementation systems are a compromise between compilers and pure interpreters:

- They translate high-level language programs to an *intermediate language* designed to allow easy interpretation.
- This method is faster than pure interpretation because the source language statements are decoded only once.
- Such implementations are called **hybrid implementation systems**.

The process used in a hybrid implementation system is shown in Figure 1.5.

![](./img/1.5.jpg ':figure Hybrid implementation system.')

Instead of translating intermediate language code to machine code, it simply interprets the intermediate code.

<div class="alert-example">

Perl is implemented with a hybrid system. Perl programs are partially compiled to detect errors before interpretation and to simplify the interpreter.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

Initial implementations of Java were all hybrid. Its intermediate form, called **byte code**, provides

- *Portability* to any machine that has a byte code interpreter.
- An associated run-time system.

Together, these are called the **Java Virtual Machine**. There are now systems that translate Java byte code into machine code for faster execution.

</div>

***Just-in-Time (JIT) Implementation System***

- A **Just-in-Time (JIT) implementation system** initially *translates* programs to an *intermediate language*.
- Then, during execution, it compiles intermediate language methods into *machine code* when they are called.
- The machine code version is kept for subsequent calls.
- JIT systems now are widely used for Java programs. Also, the .NET languages are all implemented with a JIT system.

***Combined Compilation and Interpretation***

Sometimes an implementor may provide both compiled and interpreted implementations for a language.

- In these cases, the interpreter is used to develop and debug programs.
- Then, after a (relatively) bug-free state is reached, the programs are compiled to increase their execution speed.

## Preprocessors

A **preprocessor** is a program that <mark>processes a program just before the program is compiled.</mark>

- Preprocessor instructions are embedded in programs.
- The preprocessor is essentially a *macro expander*.

Preprocessor instructions are commonly used to specify that the code from another file is to be included.

<div class="alert-example">

The C preprocessor instruction

```c
#include "myLib.h"
```

causes the preprocessor to copy the contents of `myLib.h` into the program at the position of the `#include`.

</div>

Other preprocessor instructions are used to define symbols to represent expressions.

<div class="alert-example">

One could use

```c
#define max(A, B) ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))
```

to determine the largest of two given expressions. For example, the expression

```c
x = max(2 * y, z / 1.73);
```

would be expanded by the preprocessor to

```c
x = ((2 * y) > (z / 1.73) ? (2 * y) : (z / 1.73);
```

!> Notice that this is one of those cases where expression side effects can cause trouble.

For example, if either of the expressions given to the `max` macro have side effects—such as `z++`—it could cause a problem:

```c
x = max(2 * y, z++);
```

Because one of the two expression parameters is evaluated twice, this could result in `z` being incremented twice by the code produced by the macro expansion.

```c
x = ((2 * y) > (z++) ? (2 * y) : (z++));
```

</div>

# Influences on Language Design

In addition to those factors described in Section 1.3, several other factors influence the basic design of programming languages:

- **Computer architecture**
- **Programming design methodologies**

## Computer Architecture

The basic architecture of computers has had a profound effect on language design.

- Most of the popular languages of the past 60 years have been designed around the prevalent computer architecture, called the **von Neumann architecture**.
- These languages are called **imperative languages**.

***Von Neumann Architecture***

In a von Neumann computer,

- Both **data** and **programs** are stored in the same **memory**.
- The **central processing unit (CPU)**, which executes instructions, is separate from the memory.
- Instructions and data must be transmitted, or piped, from memory to the CPU.
- Results of operations in the CPU must be moved back to memory.

Nearly all digital computers built since the 1940s have been based on the von Neumann architecture.

***Imperative Languages***

Because of the von Neumann architecture, the central features of imperative languages are

- **Variables**:

    Which model the memory cells.

- **Assignment statements**:

    Which are based on the piping operation.

- **Iteration**:

    The most efficient way to implement repetition on this architecture.

    Iteration is fast on von Neumann computers because

    - Instructions are stored in adjacent cells of memory.
    - Repeating the execution of a section of code requires only a branch instruction.

  !> This efficiency *discourages* the use of **recursion** for repetition, although recursion is sometimes more natural.

- **Operands**:

    - Operands in expressions are piped from memory to the CPU.
    - The result of evaluating the expression is piped back to the memory cell represented by the left side of the assignment.

***Imperative Languages vs. Functional Languages***

The structure of imperative programming languages is modeled on a machine architecture.

Functional (applicative) languages:

- More natural.
- Primary computation method: Applying functions to given parameters.
- Programming can be done
    - without variables.
    - without assignment statements.
    - without iteration.

!> It is unlikely that they will displace the imperative languages until a *nonâ€“von Neumann computer* is designed that allows efficient execution of programs in functional languages.

***Fetch-Execute Cycle***

The execution of a machine code program on a von Neumann architecture computer occurs in a process called the **fetch-execute cycle**.

Programs reside in memory but are executed in the CPU.

- Each instruction to be executed must be moved from memory to the processor.
- *The address of the next instruction to be executed* is maintained in a **register** called the **program counter**.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Fetch-Execute Cycle}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state initialize the $program \ counter$
\while{\true}
    \state fetch the instruction pointed to by the $program \ counter$
    \state increment the $program \ counter$ to point at the next instruction
    \state decode the instruction
    \state execute the instruction
\endWhile

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

## Programming Design Methodologies

<div class="stepper">

- 1950s and early 1960s:

    - *Simple* applications: Solving sets of equations to simulate satellite tracks.
    - Worry about *machine efficiency*.

- Late 1960s:

    Programs were being written for large and *complex* tasks, such as

    - Controlling large petroleum-refining facilities.
    - Providing worldwide airline reservation systems.

    *People efficiency* became important:

    - Readability.
    - Better control structures structured programming **top-down design**.
    - **Step-wise refinement**.

  The primary programming language deficiencies that were discovered were
  
    - Incompleteness of type checking.
    - Inadequacy of control statements (requiring the extensive use of `goto`).

- Late 1970s:

    Process-oriented to data-oriented **data abstraction**.

    - Data-oriented methods emphasize data design.
    - Focusing on the use of abstract data types to solve problems.

  Data abstraction is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.

- Middle 1980s:

    **Object-oriented programming**:

    - **Data abstraction**

        Encapsulates processing with data objects and controls access to data.

    - **Inheritance** and **Dynamic method binding**

        - Inheritance greatly enhances the potential reuse of existing software.
        - Dynamic (run-time) method binding allows more flexible use of inheritance.

    - **Polymorphism**
  
  OOP in Other Paradigms:

    - Support for object-oriented programming is now part of most popular *imperative languages*, including Java, C++, and C#.
    - Object-oriented concepts have also found their way into *functional programming* in CLOS and F#, as well as *logic programming* in Prolog++.

    Language support for object-oriented programming is discussed in detail in Chapter 12.

***Procedure-Oriented vs. Data-Oriented Programming***

Procedure-oriented programming is, in a sense, the opposite of data-oriented programming.

- Data-oriented methods now dominate software development.
- In recent years, a good deal of research has occurred in procedure-oriented programming, especially in the area of **concurrency** (is discussed in detail in Chapter 13).

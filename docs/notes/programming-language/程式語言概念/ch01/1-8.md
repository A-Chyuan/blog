# Programming Environments

A programming environment is the collection of tools used in the development of software.

- This collection may consist of only a file system, a text editor, a linker, and a compiler.
- Or it may include a large collection of integrated tools, each accessed through a uniform user interface.

In the latter case, the process of the development and maintenance of software is greatly enhanced. Therefore, the characteristics of a programming language are not the only measure of the software development capability of a system.

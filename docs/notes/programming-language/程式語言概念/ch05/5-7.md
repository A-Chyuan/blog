# Referencing Environments

The **referencing environment** of a statement is the collection of all variables that are visible in the statement.

Techniques for implementing references to nonlocal variables in both static- and dynamic-scoped languages are discussed in Chapter 10.

## Static-Scoped Languages

The referencing environment of a statement in a *static-scoped language* is

- The variables declared in its local scope,
- Plus the collection of all variables of its ancestor scopes that are visible.

In such a language, the referencing environment of a statement is needed while that statement is being compiled, so code and data structures can be created to allow references to variables from other scopes during run time.

In Python, scopes can be created by function definitions.

- The referencing environment of a statement includes the local variables, plus all of the variables declared in the functions in which the statement is nested (excluding variables in nonlocal scopes that are hidden by declarations in nearer functions).
- Each function definition creates a new scope and thus a new environment.

Consider the following Python skeletal program:

```python
g = 3; # A global

def sub1():
    a = 5; # Creates a local
    b = 7; # Creates another local
    ... <------------------------------ 1

def sub2():
    global g; # Global `g` is now assignable here
    c = 9;    # Creates a new local
    ... <------------------------------ 2

    def sub3():
        nonlocal c; # Makes nonlocal `c` visible here
        g = 11;     # Creates a new local
        ... <------------------------------ 3
```

The referencing environments of the indicated program points are as follows:

| Point | Referencing Environment                                                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | local `a` and `b` (of `sub1()`)<br /> global `g` for reference, but not for assignment |
| 2     | local `c` (of `sub2()`)<br /> global `g` for both reference and for assignment         |
| 3     | nonlocal `c` (of `sub2()`)<br /> local `g` (of `sub3()`)                                   |

Now consider the variable declarations of this skeletal program.

- First, note that, although the scope of `sub1()` is at a higher level (it is less deeply nested) than `sub3()`, the scope of `sub1()` is not a static ancestor of `sub3()`, so `sub3()` does not have access to the variables declared in `sub1()`.

- The variables declared in `sub1()` are *stack dynamic*, so they are not bound to storage if `sub1()` is not in execution.

- Because `sub3()` can be in execution when `sub1()` is not, it cannot be allowed to access variables in `sub1()`, which would not necessarily be bound to storage during the execution of `sub3()`.

## Dynamic-Scoped Languages

A subprogram is **active** if its execution has begun but has not yet terminated.

The referencing environment of a statement in a *dynamically scoped language* is

- The locally declared variables,
- Plus the variables of all other subprograms that are currently active.

Once again,

- Some variables in active subprograms can be hidden from the referencing environment.
- Recent subprogram activations can have declarations for variables that hide variables with the same names in previous subprogram activations.

Assume that the only function calls are the following: `main()` calls `sub2()`, which calls `sub1()`.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Function of Dynamic-Scoped Languages}
\begin{algorithmic}

\function{sub1}{}
    \state a, b;
\endFunction
\state \\
\function{sub2}{}
    \state b, c;
    \state \call{sub1}{}
\endFunction
\state \\
\function{main}{}
    \state c, d;
    \state \call{sub2}{}
\endFunction

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

The referencing environments of the indicated program points are as follows:

| Point | Referencing Environment                                                                                                    |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `a` and `b` of `sub1()`<br /> `c` of `sub2()`<br /> `d` of `main()`<br /> (`c` of `main()` and `b` of `sub2()` are hidden) |
| 2     | `b` and `c` of `sub2()`<br /> `d` of `main()`<br /> (`c` of `main()` is hidden)                                            |
| 3     | `c` and `d` of `main()`                                                                                                    |

The flow of control, or execution sequence, in a program can be examined at several levels.

- *Within expressions*, which is governed by operator associativity and precedence rules (Chapter 7)
- *Among program units* (Chapter 9 and 13)
- *Among program statements* (this chapter)

# Introduction

At least two additional linguistic mechanisms are necessary to make the computations in programs flexible and powerful:

- some means of *selecting* among alternative control flow paths (of statement execution).
- some means of causing the *repeated execution* of statements or sequences of statements.

Statements that provide these kinds of capabilities are called **control statements**.

In fact, it was proven that all algorithms that can be expressed by flowcharts can be coded in a programming language with only two control statements:

- One for choosing between two control flow paths.
- One for logically controlled iterations.

A **control structure** is a control statement and the collection of statements whose execution it controls.

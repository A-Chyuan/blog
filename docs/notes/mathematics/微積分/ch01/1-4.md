The function $f(x) = 2^x$ is called an *exponential function* because the variable, $x$, is the exponent.

# Exponential Functions

In general, an **exponential function** is a function of the form

$$
f(x) = b^x
$$

where $b$ is a positive constant. Letâ€™s recall what this means.

- If $x = n$, a positive integer, then

$$
b^n = \underbrace{b \cdot b \cdot \ldots \cdot b}_{n \text{ factors}}
$$

- If $x = 0$, then $b^0 = 1$.

- If $x = -n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, then

$$
b^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{b^n}
$$

- If $x$ is a rational number, $x = p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q > 0$, then

$$
b^x = b^{p/q} = \sqrt[q]{b^p} = (\sqrt[q]{b})^p
$$

## Laws of Exponents

If $a$ and $b$ are positive numbers and $x$ and $y$ are any real numbers, then

- $b^{x+y} = b^x b^y$
- $b^{x-y} = \dfrac{b^x}{b^y}$
- $(b^x)^y = b^{xy}$
- $(ab)^x = a^x b^x$

## The Number e

It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 3, that some of the formulas of calculus will be greatly simplified if we choose the base $b$ so that the slope of the tangent line to $y = b^x$ at (0, 1) is exactly 1. In fact, there is such a number and it is denoted by the letter $e$.

In Chapter 3 we will see that the value of $e$, correct to five decimal places, is

$$
e \approx 2.71828
$$

We call the function $f(x) = e^x$ the **natural exponential function**.

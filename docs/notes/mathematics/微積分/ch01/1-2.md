# Mathematical Models: A Catalog of Essential unctions

## Linear Functions

When we say that $y$ is a **linear function** of $x$, we mean that the graph of the function is a line, so we can use the *slope-intercept form (斜截式)* of the equation of a line to write a formula for the function as

$$
y = f(x) = mx + b
$$

where

- $m$ is the slope of the line.
- $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

## Polynomials

A function $P$ is called a **polynomial** if

$$
P(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_0
$$

where $n$ is a nonnegative integer and the numbers $a_0,\ a_1,\ a_2,\ \ldots ,\ a_n$ are constants called
the **coefficients** of the polynomial.

The domain of any polynomial is $\mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)$.

If the **leading coefficient** $a_n \neq 0$, then the **degree** of the polynomial is $n$.

- A polynomial of degree 1 is a linear function.
- A polynomial of degree 2 is a **quadratic function**.
- A polynomial of degree 3 is a **cubic function**.

## Power Functions

A function of the form $f(x) = x^a$, where $a$ is a constant, is called a **power function**. We
consider several cases.

***$a = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer***

- If $n$ is even, then $f(x) = x^n$ is an even function and its graph is similar to the parabola $y = x^2$.
- If $n$ is odd, then $f(x) = x^n$ is an odd function and its graph is similar to that of $y = x^3$.

***$a = \frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is a positive integer***

The function $f(x) = x^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{x}$ is a **root function**.

***$a = -1$***

The function $f(x) = x^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{x}$ is a **reciprocal function**.

***$a = -2$***

## Rational Functions

A **rational function** $f$ is a ratio of two polynomials:

$$
f(x) = \dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
$$

where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of $x$ such that $Q(x) \neq 0$.

<div class="alert-example">

$f(x) = \dfrac{2x^4 - x^2 + 1}{x^2 - 4}$ is a rational function with domain $\{ x \mid x \neq \pm 2 \}$.

</div>

## Algebraic Functions

A function $f$ is called an **algebraic function** if it can be constructed using algebraic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots) starting with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function.

<div class="alert-example">

$$
f(x) = \dfrac{x^4 - 16x^2}{x + \sqrt{x}} + (x-2) \sqrt[3]{x+1}
$$

</div>

## Transcendental Functions

Functions that are *not* algebraic are called **transcendental**; these include the:

- Trigonometric functions
- Exponential functions
- Logarithmic functions

### Trigonometric Functions

?> See: Appendix D

In calculus the convention is that *radian measure* is always used (except when otherwise indicated).

### Exponential Functions

?> See: [1-4][]

[1-4]: /notes/mathematics/微積分/ch01/1-4

The **exponential functions** are the functions of the form $f(x) = b^x$, where the base $b$ is a positive constant.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/1.9.png ':figure :size=40%')

In both cases the domain is $(-\infty, \infty)$ and the range is $(0, \infty)$.

</div>

### Logarithmic Functions

?> See: [1-5][]

[1-5]: /notes/mathematics/微積分/ch01/1-5

The logarithmic functions $f(x) = \log_b x$, where the base $b$ is a positive constant, are the inverse functions of the exponential functions.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/1.10.png ':figure :size=40%')

In each case the domain is $(0, \infty)$, the range is $(-\infty, \infty)$, and the function increases slowly when $x > 1$.

</div>

# Function

<div class="alert-note">

A **function** $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ exactly *one* element, called $f(x)$, in a set $E$.

</div>

The number $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at $x$ and is read “$f$ of $x$”.

## Domain and Range

We usually consider functions for which the sets $D$ and $E$ are sets of real numbers.

- The set $D$ is called the **domain** of the function.
- The **range** of $f$ is the set of all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout the domain.

## Independent and Dependent Variable

- A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the *domain* of a function $f$ is called an **independent variable**.
- A symbol that represents a number in the *range* of $f$ is called a **dependent variable**.

<div class="alert-example">

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

- $r$ is the independent variable.
- $A$ is the dependent variable.

</div>

## Graph

Perhaps the most useful method for visualizing a function is its **graph**. If $f$ is a function with domain $D$, then its graph is the set of ordered pairs

$$
\{ (x, f(x)) \mid x \in D \}
$$

The graph of $f$ consists of all points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane such that $y = f(x)$ and $x$ is in the domain of $f$.

## Domain Convention

The domain of the function is the set of all inputs for which the formula makes sense and gives a real-number output.

<div class="alert-example">

$$
f(x) = \sqrt{x + 2}
$$

---

Because the square root of a negative number is not defined (as a real number),
the domain of $f$ consists of all values of $x$ such that $x + 2 \geq 0$. This is equivalent to
$x \geq -2$, so the domain is the interval $[-2, \infty)$.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

$$
g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2 - x}
$$

---

Since

$$
g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2 - x} = \dfrac{1}{x(x - 1)}
$$

and division by 0 is not allowed, we see that $g(x)$ is not defined when $x = 0$ or $x = 1$. So the domain of $g$ is

$$
\{ x \mid x \neq 0, x \neq 1 \}
$$

which could also be written in interval notation as

$$
(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, 1) \cup (1, \infty)
$$

</div>

## The Vertical Line Test

A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

## Even and Odd Functions

If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for every number $x$ in its domain, then $f$ is called an **even function**.

![](./img/1.3.png ':figure :size=50% An even function.')

If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for every number $x$ in its domain, then $f$ is called an **odd function**.

![](./img/1.4.png ':figure :size=50% An odd function.')

## Increasing and Decreasing Functions

A function $f$ is called **increasing** on an interval $I$ if

$$
f(x_1) < f(x_2) \qquad \text{whenever } x_1 < x_2 \text{ in } I
$$

It is called **decreasing** on $I$ if

$$
f(x_1) > f(x_2) \qquad \text{whenever } x_1 < x_2 \text{ in } I
$$

- The numbers to be sorted are also known as the **keys**.
- When we want to sort numbers, it’s often because they are the keys associated with other data, which we call **satellite data**.
- Together, a key and satellite data form a **record**.

<div class="alert-example">

Consider a spreadsheet containing student records with many associated pieces of data such as age, grade-point average, and number of courses taken.

- Any one of these quantities could be a key, but when the spreadsheet sorts, it moves the associated record (the satellite data) with the key.
- When describing a sorting algorithm, we focus on the keys, but it is important to remember that there usually is associated satellite data.

# Insertion Sort

Our first algorithm, insertion sort, solves the **sorting problem** introduced in Chapter
1:

$\textbf{Input}$: A sequence of n numbers $\langle a_1,\ a_2,\ \dots,\ a_n \rangle$.

$\textbf{Output}$: A permutation (reordering) $\langle a'_1,\ a'_2,\ \dots,\ a'_n \rangle$ of the input sequence such
that $a'_1 \leq \ a'_2 \leq \dots \leq a'_n$

We start with insertion sort, which is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.

Insertion sort works the way you might sort a hand of playing cards.

- Start with an empty left hand and the cards in a pile on the table.
- Pick up the first card in the pile and hold it with your left hand.
- Then, with your right hand, remove one card at a time from the pile, and insert it into the correct position in your left hand.

</div>

As Figure 2.1 illustrates,

- you find the correct position for a card by comparing it with each of the cards already in your left hand, starting at the right and moving left.
- As soon as you see a card in your left hand whose value is less than or equal to the card you’re holding in your right hand, insert the card that you’re holding in your right hand just to the right of this card in your left hand.
- If all the cards in your left hand have values greater than the card in your right hand, then place this card as the leftmost card in your left hand.
- At all times, the cards held in your left hand are sorted, and these cards were originally the top cards of the pile on the table.

## Pseudocode

It takes two parameters:

- An array $A$ containing the values to be sorted.
- The number $n$ of values to sort.

The values occupy positions $A[1]$ through $A[n]$ of the array, which we denote by $A[1:n]$.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\procedure{insertion-sort}{A, n}
    \for{i = 2 to n}
        \state key = A[i]
        \state \comment{Insert A[i] into the sorted subarray A[1 : i $-$ 1].}
        \state j = i $-$ 1
        \while{j > 0 and A[j] > key}
            \state A[j + 1] = A[j]
            \state j = j $-$ 1
        \endWhile
        \state A[j + 1] = key
    \endFor
\endProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

When the insertion-sort procedure is finished, array $A[1:n]$ contains the original values, but in sorted order.

<div class="alert-example">

Figure 2.2 shows how this algorithm works for an array $A$ that starts out with the sequence $\langle 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3 \rangle$.

- The index $i$ indicates the “current card” being inserted into the hand.
- At the beginning of each iteration of the for loop, which is indexed by $i$, the subarray consisting of elements $A[1:i-1]$ constitutes the currently sorted hand.
- The remaining subarray $A[i+1:n]$ corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table.
- In fact, elements $A[1:i-1]$ are the elements *originally* in positions $1$ through $i-1$, but now in sorted order. We state these properties of $A[1:i-1]$ formally as a **loop invariant**:

## Loop Invariants

?> 可參考離散數學課程

<mark>Loop invariants help us understand why an algorithm is correct.</mark> When you’re using a loop invariant, you need to show three things:

- **Initialization**: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
- **Maintenance**: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant—usually along with the reason that the loop terminated—gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.

This method of loop invariants is used to show correctness in various places throughout this book.

<div class="alert-example">

Let’s see how these properties hold for insertion sort.

***Initialization:***

We start by showing that the loop invariant holds before the first loop iteration, when $i = 2$.

- The subarray $A[1:i-1]$ consists of just the single element $A[1]$, which is in fact the original element in $A[1]$.
- Moreover, this subarray is sorted (after all, how could a subarray with just one value not be sorted?), which shows that the loop invariant holds prior to the first iteration of the loop.

***Maintenance:***

Next, we tackle the second property: showing that each iteration maintains the loop invariant.

- Informally, the body of the for loop works by moving the values in $A[i-1]$, $A[i-2]$, $A[i-3]$, and so on by one position to the right until it finds the proper position for $A[i]$ (lines 5-9), at which point it inserts the value of $A[i]$ (line 10).
- The subarray $A[1:i]$ then consists of the elements originally in $A[1:i]$, but in sorted order.
- Incrementing $i$ (increasing its value by 1) for the next iteration of the for loop then preserves the loop invariant.

***Termination:***

Finally, we examine loop termination.

- The loop variable $i$ starts at 2 and increases by 1 in each iteration. Once $i$’s value exceeds $n$ in line 2, the loop terminates. That is, the loop terminates once $i$ equals $n+1$.
- Substituting $n+1$ for $i$ in the wording of the loop invariant yields that the subarray $A[1:n]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[1:n]$, but in sorted order.

Hence, the algorithm is correct.

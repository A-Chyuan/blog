# Introduction

## Definition

A **tree** is a finite set of one or more nodes such that:

1. There is a specially designated node called the **root**.
2. The remaining nodes are partitioned into $n \geq 0$ disjoint sets $T_1, \cdots, T_n$, where each of these sets is a tree. $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ are called the **subtrees** of the root.

Notice that this is a recursive definition.

The condition that $T_1, \cdots, T_n$ be disjoint sets prohibits subtrees from ever connecting together (i.e., there is no cross-breeding). It follows that <mark>every item in a tree is the root of some subtree of the whole.</mark>

## Terms

There are many terms that are often used when referring to trees.

- A **node** stands for the item of information plus the branches to other nodes.
- The number of subtrees of a node is called its **degree**.
- The degree of a tree is the maximum of the degree of the nodes in the tree.
- Nodes that have degree zero are called **leaf** or **terminal nodes**.
- Consequently, the other nodes are referred to as **nonterminals**.
- The roots of the subtrees of a node $X$ are the **children** of $X$. $X$ is the **parent** of its children.
- Children of the same parent are said to be **siblings**.
- The **ancestors** of a node are all the nodes along the path from the root to that node.
- The **level** of a node is defined by letting the root be at level *one*. (Note that some authors define the level of the root to be *0*.) If a node is at level $l$, then its children are at level $l + 1$.
- The **height** or **depth** of a tree is defined to be the maximum level of any node in the tree.

Consider the tree in Figure 5.2.

![](./img/5.2.png ':figure A sample tree.')

- This tree has 13 nodes, each item of data being a single letter for convenience.
- The root is $A$, and we will normally draw trees with the root at the top.
- The degree of $A$ is 3, of $C$ is 1, and of $F$ is zero.
- The tree of Figure 5.2 has degree 3.
- $\{ K,L,F,G,M,I,J \}$ is the set of leaf nodes.
- The children of $D$ are $H$, $J$, and $J$; the parent of $D$ is $A$.
- $H$, $I$, and $J$ are siblings.
- The ancestors of $M$ are $A$, $D$, and $H$.
- The depth of the tree in Figure 5.2 is 4.

## Representation of Trees

There are several ways to draw a tree besides the one presented in Figure 5.2.

### List Representation

One useful way is as a list.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/5.2.png ':figure A sample tree.')

The tree of Figure 5.2 could be written as the list

$$
(A(B(E(K,L),F),C(G),D(H(M),I,J)))
$$

</div>

The information in the root node comes first, followed by a list of the subtrees of that node.

For several applications it is desirable to have a representation that is specialized to trees.

One possibility is to represent each tree node by a memory node that has fields for the data and pointers to the tree nodeâ€™s children. Since the degree of each tree node may be different, we may be tempted to use memory nodes with a varying number of pointer fields. However, as it is often easier to write algorithms for a data representation when the node size is fixed, in practice one uses only nodes of a fixed size to represent tree nodes. For a tree of degree k, we could use the node structure of Figure 5.4. Each child field is used to point to a subtree. Lemma 5.1 shows that using this node structure is very wasteful of space.

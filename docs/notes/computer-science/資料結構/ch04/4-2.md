# Representing Chains in C

We need the following capabilities to make linked representations possible:

1. A mechanism for defining a node’s structure, that is, the fields it contains. We use *self-referential structures*, discussed in Section 2.3.4, to do this.
2. A way to create new nodes when we need them. The `MALLOC` macros defined in Section 1.2.2 handles this operation.
3. A way to remove nodes that we no longer need. The `free` function handles this operation.

We will present several small examples to show how to create and use linked lists in C.

## Example: List of Words

***Definition***

To create a linked list of words, we first define a node structure for the list. This structure specifies the type of each of the fields. From our previous discussion we know that our structure must contain a character array and a pointer to the next node.

The necessary declarations are:

```c
typedef struct listNode* listPointer;
struct listNode {
    char data[4];
    listPointer link;
};

// 或者
typedef struct listNode* listPointer;
typedef struct listNode {
    char data[4];
    listPointer link;
} listNode;

// 或者
typedef struct {
    char data[4];
    struct listNode* link;
} listNode, *listPointer;
```

These declarations contain an example of a self-referential structure. Notice that we have defined the pointer (`listPointer`) to the struct before we defined the struct (`listNode`).

<mark>C allows us to create a pointer to a type that does not yet exist</mark> because otherwise we would face a paradox: we cannot define a pointer to a nonexistent type, but to define the new type we must include a pointer to the type.

***Create a New Empty List***

This is accomplished by the statement:

```c
listPointer first = NULL;
```

This statement indicates that we have a new list called `first`. Remember that `first` contains the address of the start of the list. Since the new list is initially empty, its starting address is zero. Therefore, we use the reserved word `NULL` to signify this condition.

***`IS_EMPTY` Macro***

We also can use an `IS_EMPTY` macro to test for an empty list:

```c
#define IS_EMPTY(first) (!(first))
```

***Create New Node***

To create new nodes for our list we use the `MALLOC` macro of Section 1.2.2. We would apply this macro as follows to obtain a new node for our list:

```c
MALLOC(first, sizeof(*first));
```

***Assign Values***

We are now ready to assign values to the fields of the node. This introduces a new operator, `->`.

- The `->` operator is referred to as the structure member operator, and its use is preferred when one has a pointer to a struct rather than the `*` and dot notation.
- If `e` is a pointer to a structure that contains the field `name`, then `e->name` is a shorthand way of writing the expression `(*e).name`.

To place the word $BAT$ into our list we use the statements:

```c
strcpy(first -> data, "BAT");
first -> link = NULL;
```

These statements create the list illustrated in Figure 4.5. Notice that the node has a null link field because there is no next node in the list.

## Example: Two-Node Linked List

We want to create a linked list of integers. The node structure is defined as:

```c
typedef struct listNode* listPointer;
struct listNode {
    int data[4];
    listPointer link;
};
```

A linked list with two nodes is created by function `create2` (Program 4.1).

```c
// Program 4.1

// create a linked list with two nodes
listPointer create2() {
    listPointer first, second;
    MALLOC(first, sizeof(*first));
    MALLOC(second, sizeof(*second));
    first -> data = 10;
    first -> link = second;
    second -> data = 20;
    second -> link = NULL;
    return first;
}
```

- We set the data field of the first node to 10 and that of the second to 20.
- The variable `first` is a pointer to the first node; `second` is a pointer to the second node.
- Notice that the link field of the first node is set to point to the second node, while the link field of the second node is `NULL`.
- The variable `first`, which is the pointer to the start of the list, is returned by `create2`.

Figure 4.6 shows the resulting list structure.

## Example: List insertion

Assume that we want to insert a node with a data field of 50 after some arbitrary node `x`. Function `insert` (Program 4.2) accomplishes this task.

```c
// Program 4.2

// insert a new node with data = 50 into the chain first after node x
// 傳址版本： insert(&head, ...);
void insert(listPointer* first, listPointer x) {
    listPointer temp;
    MALLOC(temp, sizeof(*temp));
    temp -> data = 50;
    if(*first) {
        temp -> link = x -> link;
        x -> link = temp;
    } else {
        temp -> link = NULL;
        *first = temp;
    }
}

/*
傳值版本：
若改為 void insert(listPointer first, ...) { ... }
呼叫方式為 insert(head, ...);

這時只是多了一個區域變數 first，其值與 head 相同，
也就是 first 和 head 指向相同的節點。

但若在函式中執行 first = temp;
這只是讓區域變數 first 指向 temp 所指的節點，
並不會讓外部的 head 改變，也就無法真正插入第一個節點。
*/
```

In this function, we pass in two pointer variables.

- The variable, `first`, is the pointer to the first node in the list. If this variable contains a null address (i.e., there are no nodes in the list), we want to change `first` so that it points to the node with 50 in its data field. This means that <mark>we must pass in the address of `first`.</mark> This is why we use the declaration `listPointer* first`.
- Since the value of the second pointer, `x`, does not change, we do not need to pass in its address as a parameter.

***Function Call***

A typical function call would be `insert(&first, x);` where `first` points to the start of the list and `x` points to the node after which the insertion is to take place.

***Empty vs. Nonempty Lists***

The function `insert` uses an $\textbf{if} \cdots \textbf{else}$ statement to distinguish between empty and nonempty lists.

- For an empty list, we set `temp`’s link field to `NULL` and change the value of `first` to the address of `temp`.
- For a nonempty list, we insert the `temp` node between `x` and the node pointed to by its link field. Figure 4.7 shows the two cases.

![](./img/4.7.png ':figure Inserting into an empty and nonempty list.')

## Example: List deletion

Deleting an arbitrary node from a list is slightly more complicated than insertion because deletion depends on the location of the node.

Assume that we have three pointers:

- `first` points to the start of the list,
- `x` points to the node that we wish to delete, and
- `trail` points to the node that precedes `x`.

```c
// Program 4.3

// delete x from the list,
// trail is the preceding node and
// *first is the front of the list
void delete(listPointer* first, listPointer trail, listPointer x) {
    if (trail) {
        trail -> link = x -> link;
    } else {
        *first = (*first) -> link;
    }
    free(x);
}
```

An arbitrary node is deleted from a linked list by function `delete` (Program 4.3).

- In addition to changing the link fields, or the value of `*first`,
- `delete` also returns the space that was allocated to the deleted node to the system memory. To accomplish this task, we use `free`.

<div class="alert-example">

In Figure 4.8, the node to be deleted is the first node in the list. This means that we must change the value of `first`.

List before and after the function call `delete(&first, NULL, first);`:

![](./img/4.8.png ':figure')

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

In Figure 4.9, since `x` is not the first node, we simply change the link field in `trail` to point to the link field in `x`.

List after the function call `delete(&first, y, y -> link);`:

![](./img/4.9.png ':figure')

</div>

## Example: Printing Out a List

Program 4.4 prints the data fields of the nodes in a list.

```c
// Program 4.4

void printList(listPointer first) {
    printf("The list contains: ");
    // first 只是區域變數
    for (; first; first = first -> link) {
        printf("%4d", first -> data);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

To do this we first print out the contents of `first`’s data field, then we replace `first` with the address in its link field. We continue printing out the data field and moving to the next node until we reach the end of the list.

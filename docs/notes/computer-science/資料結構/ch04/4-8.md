***Limitations of Singly Linked Lists***

So far we have been working chiefly with chains and singly linked circular lists. For some problems these would be too restrictive.

- One difficulty with these lists is that if we are pointing to a specific node, say p, then we can move only in the direction of the links.
- The only way to find the node that precedes p is to start at the beginning of the list.

The same problem arises when one wishes to delete an arbitrary node from a singly linked list.

- As can be seen from Example 4.4, easy deletion of an arbitrary node requires knowing the preceding node.

# Doubly Linked Lists

If we have a problem in which it is necessary to move in either direction or in which we must delete arbitrary nodes, then it is useful to have doubly linked lists.

Each node now has two link fields,

- one linking in the forward direction and
- the other linking in the backward direction.

A node in a doubly linked list has at least three fields, a left link field (`lLink`), a data field (`data`), and a right link field (`rLink`). The necessary declarations are:

```c
typedef struct node* nodePointer;
struct node {
    nodePointer lLink;
    element data;
    nodePointer rLink;
};
```

A doubly linked list may or may not be circular.

A sample doubly linked circular list with three nodes is given in Figure 4.21.

Besides these three nodes, we have added a header node.

- As was true in previous sections, a header node allows us to implement our operations more easily.
- The data field of the header node usually contains no information.

</div>

If $ptr$ points to any node in a doubly linked list, then:

$$
ptr = ptr \rightarrow lLink \rightarrow rLink = ptr \rightarrow rLink \rightarrow lLink
$$

This formula reflects the essential virtue of this structure, namely, that we can go back and forth with equal ease.

***Empty List***

An empty list is not really empty since it always has a header node whose structure is illustrated in Figure 4.22.

***Insertion***

To use doubly linked lists we must be able to insert and delete nodes.

Insertion into a doubly linked list is fairly easy. Assume that we have two nodes, `node` and `newNode`, `node` may be either a header node or an interior node in a list.

The function `insert` (Program 4.26) performs the insertion operation in constant time.

```c
// Program 4.26

// insert newNode to the right of node
void insert(nodePointer node, nodePointer newNode) {
    newNode -> lLink = node;
    newNode -> rLink = node -> rLink;
    node -> rLink -> lLink = newNode;
    node -> rLink = newNode;
}
```

***Deletion***

Deletion from a doubly linked list is equally easy.

The function `delete` (Program 4.27) deletes the node `deleted` from the list pointed to by node. To accomplish this deletion, we only need to change the link fields of the nodes precede (`deleted -> lLink -> rLink`) and follow (`deleted -> rLink -> lLink`) the node we want to delete.

```c
// Program 4.27

// delete from the doubly linked list
void delete(nodePointer node, nodePointer deleted) {
    if (node == deleted) {
        printf("Deletion of header node not permitted.\n");
    } else {
        deleted -> lLink -> rLink = deleted -> rLink;
        deleted -> rLink -> lLink = deleted -> lLink;
        free(deleted);
    }
}
```

Figure 4.23 shows the deletion in a doubly linked list with a single node.

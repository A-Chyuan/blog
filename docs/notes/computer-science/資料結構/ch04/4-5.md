# Additional List Operations

## Operations For Chains

It is often necessary, and desirable, to build a variety of functions for manipulating singly linked lists. Some that we have seen already are `getNode` and `retNode`, which get and return nodes to the available space list. ([4-4][])

### Inverting

Inverting (or reversing) a chain (Program 4.16) is another useful operation. This routine is especially interesting because we can do it “*in place*” if we use three pointers.

We use the following declarations:

```c
typedef struct listNode* listPointer;
struct listNode {
    char data;
    listPointer link;
};
```

```c
// Program 4.16

// invert the list pointed to by lead
listPointer invert(listPointer lead) {
    listPointer middle, trail;
    middle = NULL;
    while (lead) {
        trail = middle;
        middle = lead;
        lead = lead -> link;
        middle -> link = trail;
    }
    return middle;
}
```

Try out this function with at least three examples, an empty list and lists of one and two nodes, so that you understand how it works.

For a list of $\text{length} \geq 1$ nodes, the while loop is executed $\text{length}$ times and so the computing time is linear or $O(\text{length})$.

### Concatenation

Another useful function is one that concatenates two chains, `ptr1` and `ptr2` (Program 4.17).

```c
// produce a new list that
// contains the list ptr1 followed by the list ptr2.
// the list pointed to by ptr1 is changed permanently.
listPointer concatenate(listPointer prt1, listPointer ptr2) {
    listPointer temp;

    // check for empty lists
    if (!ptr1) return ptr2;
    if (!ptr2) return ptr1;

    // neither list is empty, find end of first list
    for (temp = ptr1; temp -> link; temp = temp -> link) {}

    // link end of first to start of second
    temp -> link = ptr2;
}
```

The complexity of this function is $O(\text{length of list } ptr1)$.

Since this function does not allocate additional storage for the new list, `ptr1` also contains the concatenated list. (The exercises explore a concatenation function that does not alter `ptr1`.)

## Operations For Circularly Linked Lists

Now let us take another look at circular lists like the one in Figure 4.14.

![](./img/4.14.png ':figure')

<mark>By keeping a pointer `last` to the last node in the list rather than to the first, we are able to insert an element at *both* the front and end with ease.</mark>

- Had we kept a pointer to the first node instead of the last node, inserting at the front would require us to must move down the entire length of the list until we find the last node so that we can change the pointer in the last node to point to the new first node.

***Function `insertFront`***

Program 4.18 gives the code at insert a node at the front of a circular list. To insert at the rear, we only need to add the additional statement `*last = node` to the else clause of `insertFront` (Program 4.18).

```c
// Program 4.18

// insert node at the front of the circular list
// whose last node is last
void insertFront(listPointer* last, listPointer node) {
    if (!(*last)) {
        // list is empty, change last to point to new entry
        *last = node;
        node -> link = node;  // circular list
    } else {
        // list is not empty, add new entry at front
        node -> link = (*last) -> link;
        (*last) -> link = node;
    }
}
```

***Function `length`***

As another example of a simple function for circular lists, we write a function (Program 4.19) that determines the length of such a list.

```c
// Program 4.19

// find the length of the circular list last
int length(listPointer last) {
    listPointer temp;
    int count = 0;
    if (last) {
        temp = last;
        do {
            count++;
            temp = temp -> link;
        } while (temp != last);
    }
    return count;
}
```

# Linked Stacks and Queues

- Previously we represented stacks and queues sequentially. Such a representation proved efficient if we had only one stack or one queue.
- However, when several stacks and queues coexisted, there was no efficient way to represent them sequentially.

Figure 4.11 shows a linked stack and a linked queue.

![](./img/4.11.png ':figure Linked stack and queue.')

Notice that the direction of links for both the stack and the queue facilitate easy insertion and deletion of nodes.

- In the case of Figure 4.11(a), we can easily add or delete a node from the top of the stack.
- In the case of Figure 4.11(b), we can easily add a node to the rear of the queue and add or delete a node at the front, although we normally will not add items to the front of a queue.

The solution presented above to the $n$-stack, $m$-queue problem is both computationally and conceptually simple. (希望在同一塊記憶體空間中，同時管理 n 個堆疊與 m 個佇列)

- We no longer need to shift stacks or queues to make space. Computation can proceed as long as there is memory available.
- Although we need additional space for the link field, the use of linked lists makes sense because the overhead incurred by the storage of the links is overridden by
    1. the ability to represent lists in a simple way, and
    2. the reduced computing time required by linked representations. (不需要再移動陣列中的資料)

## Linked Stack

If we wish to represent $n < \text{MAX_STACKS}$ stacks simultaneously, we begin with the declarations:

```c
#define MAX_STACKS 10  // maximum number of stacks

typedef struct {
    int key;
    // other fields
} element;

typedef struct stack* stackPointer;
struct stack {
    element data;
    stackPointer link;
};

stackPointer top[MAX_STACKS];
```

We assume that the initial condition for the stacks is:

$$
\text{top}[i] = \text{NULL}, \quad 0 \leq i \leq \text{MAX_STACKS}
$$

and the boundary condition is:

$$
\text{top}[i] = \text{NULL} \iff \text{the $i$th stack is empty}
$$

***Functions `push`***

Functions `push` (Program 4.5) add item to a stack.

```c
// Program 4.5

// add item to the ith stack
void push(int i, element item) {
    stackPointer temp;
    MALLOC(temp, sizeof(*temp));
    temp -> data = item;
    temp -> link = top[i]
    top[i] = temp;
}
```

- Function `push` creates a new node, `temp`, and places `item` in the data field and `top` in the link field.
- The variable `top` is then changed to point to `temp`.
- A typical function call to add an element to the $i$th stack would be `push(i, item)`.

***Function `pop`***

`pop` (Program 4.6) delete item from a stack.

```c
// Program 4.6

// remove top element from the ith stack
element pop(int i) {
    stackPointer temp = top[i];
    element item;
    if (!temp) {
        return stackEmpty();
    }
    item = temp -> data;
    top[i] = temp -> link;
    free(temp);
    return item;
}
```

- Function `pop` returns the top element and changes `top` to point to the address contained in its link field.
- The removed node is then returned to system memory.
- A typical function call to delete an element from the $i$th stack would be `item = pop(i);`

## Linked Queue

To represent $m < \text{MAX_QUEUES}$ queues simultaneously, we begin with the declarations:

```c
#define MAX_QUEUES 10  // maximum number of queues

typedef struct queue* queuePointer;
struct queue {
    element data;
    queuePointer link;
};

queuePointer front[MAX_QUEUES], rear[MAX_QUEUES];
```

We assume that the initial condition for the queues is:

$$
\text{front}[i] = \text{NULL}, \quad 0 \leq i \leq \text{MAX_QUEUES}
$$

and the boundary condition is:

$$
\text{front}[i] = \text{NULL} \iff \text{the $i$th queue is empty}
$$

***Function `add` (enqueue)***

Function `add` is more complex than `push` because we must check for an empty queue.

- If the queue is empty, we change `front` to point to the new node;
- otherwise we change `rear`’s link field to point to the new node.
- In either case, we then change `rear` to point to the new node.

Typical function calls would be `add(i, item);`.

***Function `delete` (dequeue)***

- Function `delete` is similar to `pop` since we are removing the node that is currently at the start of the list.
- Typical function calls would be `item = delete(i);`.

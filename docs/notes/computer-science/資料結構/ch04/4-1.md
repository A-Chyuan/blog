***Sequential Mapping***

In the previous chapters, we studied the representation of simple data structures using an array and a *sequential mapping*. These representations had the property that <mark>successive nodes of the data object were stored a fixed distance apart.</mark> Thus,

1. if the element $a_{ij}$ of a table was stored at location $L_{ij}$, then $a_{i,j+1}$ was at the location $L_{ij+1}$;
2. if the $i$th element in a queue was at location $L_i$, then the $(i + 1)$th element was at location $L_i + 1\ \%\ n$ for the circular representation;
3. if the topmost node of a stack was at location $L_T$, then the node beneath it was at location $L_{T-1}$, and so on.

These sequential storage schemes proved adequate for the tasks we wished to perform (accessing an arbitrary node in a table, insertion or deletion of stack and queue elements).

<mark>However, when a sequential mapping is used for ordered lists, operations such as insertion and deletion of arbitrary elements become expensive.</mark>

<div class="alert-example">

Consider the following list of three-letter English words ending in $AT$:

$$
\begin{align}
& (BAT, CAT, EAT, FAT, HAT, JAT, LAT,\\
& \quad MAT, OAT, PAT, RAT, SAT, VAT, WAT)
\end{align}
$$

If we are using an array and a sequential mapping to keep this list, then the insertion of $GAT$ will require us to move elements already in the list either one location higher or lower.

- We must move either $HAT, JAT, LAT, \ldots, WAT$ or $BAT, CAT, EAT,$ and $FAT$.
- If we have to do many such insertions into the middle, neither alternative is attractive because of the amount of data movement.
- Excessive data movement also is required for deletions. Suppose we decide to remove the word $LAT$. Then again, we have to move many elements so as to maintain the sequential representation of the list.

# Singly Linked Lists and Chains

***Differences Between Sequential and Linked Representations***

An elegant solution to this problem of data movement in sequential representations is achieved by using linked representations.

- Unlike a sequential representation, in which successive items of a list are located a fixed distance apart, <mark>in a linked representation these items may be placed anywhere in memory.</mark>
- In other words, in a sequential representation the order of elements is the same as in the ordered list, whereas in a linked representation these two sequences need not be the same.

***Access List Elements***

<mark>To access list elements in the correct order, with each element we store the address or location of the next element in that list.</mark>

- Thus, associated with each data item in a linked representation is a pointer or link to the next item.
- In general, a linked list is comprised of nodes; each node has zero or more data fields and one or more link or pointer fields.

<div class="alert-example">

Figure 4.1 shows how some of the elements in our list of three-letter words may be represented in memory by using pointers.

![](./img/4.1.png ':figure Nonsequential list-representation.')

The elements of the list are stored in a one-dimensional array called data, but the elements *no longer* occur in sequential order, $BAT$ before $CAT$ before $EAT$, and so on.

Instead we relax this restriction and allow them to appear anywhere in the array and in any order. To remind us of the real order, a second array, `link`, is added. The values in this array are pointers to elements in the data array.

For any `i`, `data[i]` and `link[i]` together comprise a node.

- Since the list starts at `data[8] = BAT`, let us set a variable `first = 8`.
- `link[8]` has the value `3`, which means it points to `data[3]`, which contains $CAT$.
- Since `link[3] = 4`, the next element, $EAT$, in the list is in `data[4]`.
- The element after $EAT$ is in `data[link[4]]`.
- By continuing in this way we can list all the words in the proper order. We recognize that we have come to the end of our ordered list when link equals zero.

To ensure that a link of zero always signifies the end of a list, we do not use position zero of data to store a list element.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

It is customary to draw linked lists as an ordered sequence of nodes with links being represented by arrows, as in Figure 4.2.

![](./img/4.2.png ':figure Usual way to draw a linked list.')

Notice that we do not explicitly put in the values of the pointers but simply draw arrows to indicate they are there. The arrows reinforce in our own mind the facts that

1. the nodes do not actually reside in sequential locations.
2. the actual locations of nodes are immaterial. Therefore, when we write a program that works with lists, we do not look for a specific address except when we test for zero.

</div>

The linked structures of Figures 4.1 and 4.2 are called **singly linked lists** or **chains**.

- In a singly linked list, each node has exactly *one* pointer field.

A chain is a singly linked list that is comprised of zero or more nodes.

- When the number of nodes is zero, the chain is empty.
- The nodes of a non-empty chain are ordered so that the first node links to the second node; the second to the third; and so on. The last node of a chain has 0 link.

***Insertions***

Let us now see why it is easier to make insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions using a linked list rather than a sequential list.

<div class="alert-example">

<div class="stepper">

To insert the data item $GAT$ between $FAT$ and $HAT$, the following steps are adequate:

- <div>

    Get a node `a` that is currently unused.

  </div>

- <div>

    Set the data field of `a` to $GAT$.

  </div>

- <div>

    Set the link field of `a` to point to the node after $FAT$, which contains $HAT$.

  </div>

- <div>

    Set the link field of the node containing $FAT$ to `a`.

  </div>

</div>

![](./img/4.3.png 'Inserting into a linked list.')

- Figure 4.3(a) shows how the arrays data and link will be changed after we insert GAT.
- Figure 4.3(b) shows how we can draw the insertion using our arrow notation.

Dashed arrows are new ones. <mark>The important thing to notice is that when we insert $GAT$, we do not have to move any elements that are already in the list.</mark>

We have overcome the need to move data at the expense of the storage needed for the field link. (只需額外花費一個指標的空間，就能節省移動資料的時間)

- Usually, this penalty is not too severe.
- When each list element is large, significant time is saved by not having to move elements during an insert or delete.

</div>

***Deletions***

<div class="alert-example">

Now suppose we want to delete $GAT$ from the list.

All we need to do is find the element that immediately precedes $GAT$, which is $FAT$, and set `link[9]` to the position of $HAT$ which is 1.

Again, there is no need to move the data around. Even though the link of $GAT$ still contains a pointer to $HAT$, $GAT$ is no longer in the list as it cannot be reached by starting at the first element of list and following links (see Figure 4.4).

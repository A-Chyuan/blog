# Dynamically Allocated Arrays

[Why does C++ require a cast for malloc() but C doesn't?][]

<blockquote>

- C allows void pointers to be implicitly converted to any other object pointer type. C++ does not.
- If you're writing C++, you should be using `new` and `delete` instead of `malloc()` and `free()`.

## One-Dimensional Arrays

When writing computer programs, we often find ourselves in a situation where we cannot reliably determine how large an array to use. A good solution to this problem is to defer this decision to run time and allocate the array when we have a good estimate of the required array size.

<div class="alert-example">

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int i, n;
    printf("Enter the number of numbers to generate: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n < 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Improper value of n\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    int *list = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
}
```

Now, the program fails only when $n < 1$ or we do not have sufficient memory to hold the list of numbers that are to be sorted.

</div>

## Two-Dimensional Arrays

C uses the so-called array-of-arrays representation to represent a multidimensional array. In this representation, a two-dimensional array is represented as a one-dimensional array in which each element is, itself, a one-dimensional array.

<div class="alert-example">

To represent the two-dimensional array

```c
int x[3][5];
```

we actually create a one-dimensional array `x` whose length is 3; each element of x is a one-dimensional array whose length is 5.

Figure 2.2 shows the memory structure.

![](./img/2.2.png ':figure Array-of-arrays representation.')

- Four separate memory blocks are used.
- One block (the lightly shaded block) is large enough for three pointers and each of the remaining blocks is large enough for 5 `int`s.

</div>

C finds the element `x[i][j]` by first accessing the pointer in `x[i]`. This pointer gives us the address, in memory, of the zeroth element of row `i` of the array. Then by adding `j * sizeof(int)` to this pointer, the address of the `[j]`th element of row `i` (i.e., element `x[i][j]`) is determined.

<div class="alert-example">

Program gives a function that creates a two-dimensional array at run time.

```c
/* create a two dimensional rows ⨉ cols array */
int **make2dArray(int rows, int cols) {
    int **x, i;

    // get memory for row pointers
    x = malloc(rows * sizeof(*x));

    // get memory for each row
    for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        x[i] = malloc(cols * sizeof(**x));
    }
    return x;
}
```

This function may be used in the following way, for example.

```c
int **myArray;
myArray = make2dArray(5, 10);
myArray[2][4] = 6;
```

- The second line allocates memory for a 5 by 10 two-dimensional array of integers.
- The third line assigns the value 6 to the `[2][4]` element of this array.

</div>

## Three-Dimensional Arrays

A three-dimensional array is represented as a one-dimensional array, each of whose elements is a two-dimensional array. Each of these two-dimensional arrays is represented as shown in Figure 2.2.

## Memory Allocation Functions

C provides two additional memory allocation functions—`calloc` and `realloc`—that
are useful in the context of dynamically allocated arrays.

***Function `calloc`***

The function `calloc` allocates a user-specified amount of memory and initializes the allocated memory to 0 (i.e., all allocated bits are set to 0); a pointer to the start of the allocated memory is returned. In case there is insufficient memory to make the allocation, the returned value is `NULL`.

<div class="alert-example">

The statements

```c
int *x;
x = calloc(n, sizeof(int));
```

could be used to define a one-dimensional array of integers; the capacity of this array is `n`, and `x[0:n—1]` are initially 0.

</div>

As was the case with `malloc`, it is useful to define the macro `CALLOC` as below and use this macro to write clean robust programs.

***Function `realloc`***

The function `realloc` resizes memory previously allocated by either `malloc` or `calloc`.

<div class="alert-example">

The statement

```c
realloc(p, s);
```

changes the size of the memory block pointed at by `p` to `s`.

The contents of the first $\text{min\{s, oldSize\}}$ bytes of the block are unchanged as a result of this resizing.

- When $\text{s} > \text{oldSize}$ the additional $\text{s} - \text{oldSize}$ have an unspecified value.
- When $\text{s} < \text{oldSize}$, the rightmost $\text{oldSize} - \text{s}$ bytes of the old block are freed.

When `realloc` is able to do the resizing, it returns a pointer to the start of the new block and when it is unable to do the resizing, the old block is unchanged and the function returns the value `NULL`.

</div>

As with `malloc` and `calloc`, it is useful to define a macro `REALLOC` as below.

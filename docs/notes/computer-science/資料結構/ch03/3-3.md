# Queues

A **queue** is an ordered list in which insertions (also called additions, puts, and pushes) and deletions (also called removals and pops) take place at different ends.

- The end at which new elements are added is called the **rear**, and
- that from which old elements are deleted is called the **front**.

Since the first element inserted into a queue is the first element removed, queues are also known as *First-In-First-Out (FIFO)* lists.

<div class="alert-example">

The restrictions on a queue imply that if we insert A, B, C, D, and E in that order, then A is the first element deleted from the queue. Figure 3.4 illustrates this sequence of events.

## Queue ADT

The representation of a queue in sequential locations is more difficult than that of the stack. The simplest scheme employs a one-dimensional array and two variables, `front` and `rear`. Given this representation, we can define the queue operations in ADT 3.2 as:

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{ADT Queue}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $\textbf{objects:}$
\state a finite ordered list with zero or more elements. \\\\

\state $\textbf{functions:}$
\state  for all queue $\in$ Queue, \\
        $\hspace{2.65em}$ item $\in$ element, \\
        $\hspace{2.65em}$ maxQueueSize $\in$ positive integer.

\state \\

\function{CreateQ}{maxQueueSize}
    \return an empty queue whose maximum size is maxQueueSize.
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{IsEmpty}{queue}
    \if{queue == \call{CreateQ}{maxQueueSize}}
        \return TRUE
    \else
        \return FALSE
    \endIf
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{IsFull}{queue, maxQueueSize}
    \if{(number of elements in queue == maxQueueSize)}
        \return TRUE
    \else
        \return FALSE
    \endIf
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{Add}{queue, item}
    \if{\call{IsFull}{queue}}
        \state \call{queueFull}{}
    \else
        \state insert item at rear of queue.
        \return queue
    \endIf
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{Delete}{queue}
    \if{$\lnot$\call{IsEmpty}{queue}}
        \state $\textbf{remove}$ and $\textbf{return}$ the item at front of queue.
    \endIf
\endFunction

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

```c
#define MAX_QUEUE_SIZE 100 // maximum queue size

typedef struct {
    int key;
    // other fields
} element;

// CreatQ
element queue[MAX_QUEUE_SIZE];
int rear = -1;
int front = -1;

bool IsEmpty() {
    return front == rear;
}

bool IsFull() {
    return rear == MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1;  // 線性 queue
}
```

- Since the `IsEmpty` and `IsFull` operations are quite simple, we again implement them directly in the `add` (Program 3.5) and `delete` (Program 3.6) functions.
- The implementation of `queueFull` is similar to that of `stackFull` (Program 3.3).
- Functions `add` and `delete` are structurally similar to `push` and `pop` on stacks. While the stack uses the variable `top` in both `push` and `pop`, the `queue` increments `rear` in `add` and `front` in `delete`.

Typical function calls would be `add(item)`; and `item = delete()`;.

***Function `add`***

```c
// add an item to the queue
void add(element item) {
    if (isFull()) {
        queueFull();
        return;
    }
    queue[++rear] = item;
}
```

***Function `delete`***

```c
// remove element at the front of the queue
element delete() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
        // return an error key
        return queueEmpty();
    }
    return queue[++front];
}
```

This sequential representation of a queue has pitfalls that are best illustrated by an example.

## Example: Job Scheduling

Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system.

- If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system.

The following Figure illustrates how an operating system might process jobs if it used a sequential representation for its queue.

| front | rear | $Q[0] \quad Q[1] \quad Q[2] \quad Q[3]$ | Comments         |
| ----- | ---- | :-------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| -1    | -1   |                                         | queue is empty   |
| -1    | 0    | $J1$                                    | Job 1 is added   |
| -1    | 1    | $J1 \quad\ \ \ J2$                      | Job 2 is added   |
| -1    | 2    | $J1 \quad\ \ \ J2 \quad\ \ \ J3$        | Job 3 is added   |
| 0     | 2    | $\hspace{2.8em} J2 \quad\ \ \ J3$       | Job 1 is deleted |
| 1     | 2    | $\hspace{5.6em} J3$                     | Job 2 is deleted |

It should be obvious that as jobs enter and leave the system, the queue gradually shifts to the right.

- This means that eventually the rear index equals `MAX-QUEUE_SIZE - 1`, suggesting that the queue is full.
- In this case, `queueFull` should move the entire queue to the left so that the first element is again at `queue[0]` and `front` is at `-1`.
- It should also recalculate `rear` so that it is correctly positioned.

Shifting an array is very time-consuming, particularly when there are many elements in it. In fact, `queueFull` has a worst case complexity of $O(\text{MAX_QUEUE_SIZE})$.

因此後續介紹環狀 queue 來改善線性 queue。

## Circular Queue

We can obtain a more efficient queue representation if we permit the queue to wrap around the end of the array. At this time it is convenient to think of the array positions as arranged in a circle (Figure 3.6) rather than in a straight line.

![](./img/3.6.png ':figure Circular queue.')

In Figure 3.6,

- we have changed the convention for the variable `front`. This variable now points one position counterclockwise from the location of the front element in the queue.
- The convention for `rear` is unchanged.

This change simplifies the codes slightly. When the array is viewed as a circle, each array position has a next and a previous position.

- The position next to position `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1` is `0`, and the position that precedes `0` is `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1`.
- When the queue rear is at `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1`, the next element is put into position `0`.
- To work with a circular queue, we must be able to move the variables `front` and `rear` from their current position to the next position (clockwise). This may be done using code such as

```c
if (rear == MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1)  // 只能用在線性 queue
    rear = 0;
else
    rear++;
```

Using the modulus operator, which computes remainders, this code is equivalent to

```c
(rear + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE
```

With our conventions for `front` and `rear`, we see that

- the front element of the queue is located one position clockwise from `front`.
- the rear element is at position `rear`.

To determine a suitable test for an empty queue, we experiment with the queues of Figure 3.6.

- To delete an element, we advance `front` one position clockwise.
- To add an element, we advance `rear` one position clockwise and insert at the new position.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/3.6.png ':figure Circular queue.')

- If we perform 3 deletions from the queue of Figure 3.6(c) in this fashion, we will see that the queue becomes empty and that $\text{front} = \text{rear}$.
- When we do 4 additions to the queue of Figure 3.6(b), the queue becomes full and $\text{front} = \text{rear}$.

So, we cannot distinguish between an empty and a full queue. To avoid the resulting confusion,

- we shall increase the capacity of a queue just before it becomes full.
- Consequently, `front == rear` iff the queue is empty. The initial value for both `front` and `rear` is 0.

</div>

Programs 3.7 and 3.8, respectively, given the codes to `add` and `delete`. The code for `queueFull` is similar to that of the `stackFull` code of Program 3.3.

***Function `add` and `delete`***

```c
// Program 3.7
// add an item to the queue
void add(element item) {
    if (front == (rear + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE) {
        queueFull();  // print error and exit
        return;
        // 為了避免新增元素後造成 front == rear
        // 導致分不清 queue 是滿了還空了
        // 因此不會新增該元素，儘管實際上 queue[front] 是可以使用的空間
        // 也就是 queue 中最多只能有 MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1 個元素
        // 而非 MAX_QUEUE_SIZE 個元素
    }
    rear = (rear + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE;
    queue[rear] = item;
}
```

```c
// Program 3.8
// remove front element from the queue
element delete() {
    if (front == rear) {
        return queueEmpty();  // return an error key
    }
    front = (front + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE;
    return queue[front];
}
```

Observe that the test for a full queue in `add` and the test for an empty queue in `delete` are the same.

- In the case of `add`, however, when `front == rear` is evaluated and found to be true, there is actually one space free (`queue[rear]`) since the first element in the queue is not at `queue[front]` but is one position clockwise from this point.
- As remarked earlier, if we insert an item here, then we will not be able to distinguish between the cases of full and empty, since the insertion would leave `front` equal to `rear`.
- To avoid this we signal `queueFull`, thus permitting a maximum of `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1` rather than `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` elements in the queue at any time. We leave the implementation of `queueFull` as an exercise.

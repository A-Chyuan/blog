# A Mazing Problem

We are interested in mazes since they present a nice application of *stacks*.

In this section, we develop a program that runs a maze. Although this program takes many false paths before it finds a correct one, once found it can correctly rerun the maze without taking any false paths.

***Representation of The Maze***

In creating this program the first issue that confronts us is the representation of the maze.

<div class="alert-example">

The most obvious choice is a two dimensional array in which

- zeros represent the open paths and
- ones the barriers.

</div>

***Possible Moves***

If $X$ marks the spot of our current location, `maze[row][col]`, then Figure 3.9 shows the possible moves from this position.

![](./img/3.9.png ':figure Allowable moves.')

We use compass points to specify the eight directions of movement: north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

We must be careful here because not every position has eight neighbors.

- If $[\text{row}, \text{col}]$ is on a border then less than eight, and possibly only three, neighbors exist.
- To avoid checking for these border conditions we can surround the maze by a border of ones. Thus an $m \times p$ maze will require an $(m + 2) \times (p + 2)$ array.
- The entrance is at position $[1][1]$ and the exit at $[m][p]$.

*Another* device that will simplify the problem is to predefine the possible directions to move in an array, `move`, As shown in the following table.

| Name | Dir | `move[dir].vert` | `move[dir].horiz` |
| ---- | --- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| N    | 0   | -1               | 0                 |
| NE   | 1   | -1               | 1                 |
| E    | 2   | 0                | 1                 |
| SE   | 3   | 1                | 1                 |
| S    | 4   | 1                | 0                 |
| SW   | 5   | 1                | -1                |
| W    | 6   | 0                | -1                |
| NW   | 7   | -1               | -1                |

This is obtained from Figure 3.9. We represent the eight possible directions of movement by the numbers from 0 to 7. For each direction, we indicate the vertical and horizontal offset.

The C declarations needed to create this table are:

```c
typedef struct {
    short int vert;
    short int horiz;
} offsets;

offsets move[8];  // array of moves for each direction 
```

We assume that `move` is initialized according to the data shown in the previous table. This means that if we are at position, `maze[row]|[col]`, and we wish to find the position of the next move, `maze[nextRow][nextCol]`, we set:

```c
nextRow = row + move[dir].vert;
nextCol = col + move[dir].horiz;
```

As we move through the maze, we may have the choice of several directions of movement. Since we do not know which choice is best, we save our current position and arbitrarily pick a possible move.

- By saving our current position, we can return to it and try another path if we take a hopeless path.
- We examine the possible moves starting from the north and moving clockwise.
- Since we do not want to return to a previously tried path, we maintain a second two-dimensional array, `mark`, to record the maze positions already checked. We initialize this array’s entries to zero. When we visit a position, `maze[row][col]`, we change `mark[row][col]` to one.

## Maze Traversal Algorithm

`EXIT_ROW` and `EXIT_COL` give the coordinates of the maze exit.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Maze Traversal Algorithm (Program 3.11)}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state  initialize a stack to the maze’s entrance coordinates and direction to north
\state \\

\while{stack is not empty}

    \state \comment{move to position at top of stack}
    \state <row, col, dir> := \call{pop}{stack}
    \state \\

    \while{there are more moves from current position}

        \state <nextRow, nextCol> := coordinates of next move
        \state dir := direction of move
        \state \\

        \if{(nextRow = EXIT\_ROW) and \\ $\hspace{0.7em}$ (nextCol = EXIT\_COL)}
            \state success
        \endIf
        \state \\

        \if{(maze[nextRow][nextCol] = 0) and \\ $\hspace{0.7em}$ (mark[nextRow][nextCol] = 0)}
            \state \comment{legal move and haven’t been there}
            \state mark[nextRow][nextCol] = 1
            \state \comment{save current position and direction}
            \state \call{push}{stack, <row, col, dir>}
            \state row := nextRow
            \state col := nextCol
            \state dir := north
        \endIf
        \state \\

    \endWhile
\endWhile
\state \\

\state \call{print}{"No path found"}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Although this algorithm describes the essential processing, we must still resolve several issues. Our first concern is with the representation of the stack. Examining Program 3.11, we see that the stack functions created in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 will work if we redefine element as:

```c
typedef struct {
    short int row;
    short int col;
    short int dir;
} element;
```

- If we use the stack implementation of Section 3.1, we also need to determine a reasonable bound for the stack size.
- While such a bound is not required when array doubling is used as in Section 3.2, we will need more memory on our computer to guarantee successful completion of the program.

***Capacity of Stack***

Since each position in the maze is visited no more than once, the stack need have only as many positions as there are zeroes in the maze.

- The maze of Figure 3.11 has only one entrance to exit path.
- When searching this maze for an entrance to exit path, all positions (except the exit) with value zero will be on the stack when the exit is reached.
- Since, an $m \times p$ maze, can have at most $m \cdot p$ zeroes, it is sufficient for the stack to have this capacity.

***Implementation***

Program 3.12 contains the maze search algorithm.

- We assume that the arrays, `maze`, `mark`, `move`, and `stack`, along with the constants `EXIT_ROW`, `EXIT_COL`, and the variable, `top`, are declared as *global*.
- Notice that `path` uses a variable `found` that is initially set to `false`. If we find a path through the maze, we set this variable to `true`, thereby allowing us to exit both while loops gracefully.

```c
// Program 3.12

// output a path through the maze if such a path exists
void path(void) {
    bool found = false;
    int row, col, nextRow, nextCol, dir;
    element position;

    // 入口在 (1, 1)，免除掉邊界的方向檢查
    mark[1][1] = 1;  // 使用 mark[] 紀錄有無走過
    top = 0;
    stack[0].row = 1;
    stack[0].col = 1;
    stack[0].dir = 1;

    while (top > -1 && !found) {
        position = pop();
        row = position.row;
        col = position.col;
        dir = position.dir;
        while (dir < 8 && !found) {
            // move in direction dir
            nextRow = row + move[dir].vert;
            nextCol = col + move[dir].horiz;
            if (nextRow == EXIT_ROW && nextCol == EXIT_COL) {
                found = true;
            } else if (!maze[nextRow][nextCol] && !mark[nextRow][nextCol]) {
                mark[nextRow][nextCol] = 1;
                position.row = row;
                position.col = col;
                position.dir = ++dir;
                push(position);
                // DFS, 深度優先
                row = nextRow;
                col = nextCol;
                dir = 0;
            } else {
                ++dir;
            }
        }

        if (found) {
            printf("The path is:\n");
            printf("row  col\n");
            for (int i = 0; i <= top; i++) {
                printf("%2d%5d\n", stack[i].row, stack[i].col);
            }
            printf("%2d%5d\n", row, col);
            printf("%2d%5d\n", EXIT_ROW, EXIT_COL);

        } else {
            printf("The maze does not have a path\n");
        }
    }
}
```

***Analysis of `path`***

The size of the maze determines the computing time of path.

- Since each position within the maze is visited no more than once, the worst case complexity of the algorithm is $O(m \cdot p)$ where $m$ and $p$ are, respectively, the number of rows and columns of the maze.

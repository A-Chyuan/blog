# Evaluation of Expressions

Compilers typically use a parenthesis-free notation referred to as postfix. In this notation, each operator appears after its operands.

<div class="alert-example">

| Infix                 | Postfix         |
| :-------------------- | :-------------- |
| $2+3*4$               | $234*+$         |
| $a*b+5\ $             | $ab*5+$         |
| $(1+2)*7$             | $12+7*$         |
| $a*b/c$               | $ab*c/$         |
| $(a/(b-c+d))*(e-a)*c$ | $abc-d+/ea-*c*$ |
| $a/b-c+d*e-a*c$       | $ab/c-de*+ac*-$ |

</div>

We tackle the easier task of evaluating postfix expressions.

- This evaluation process is much simpler than the evaluation of infix expressions because there are no parentheses to consider.
- To evaluate an expression we make a single left-to-right scan of it. We place the operands on a *stack* until we find an operator.
- We then remove, from the stack, the correct number of operands for the operator, perform the operation, and place the result back on the stack.
- We continue in this fashion until we reach the end of the expression. We then remove the answer from the top of the stack.

<div class="alert-example">

The processing when the input is the nine character string $62/3-42*+$.

| Token | `stack[0]`  | `stack[1]` | `stack[2]` | Top |
| :---- | :---------- | :--------- | :--------- | :-- |
| $6$   | $6$         |            |            | 0   |
| $2$   | $6$         | $2$        |            | 1   |
| $/$   | $6/2$       |            |            | 0   |
| $3$   | $6/2$       | $3$        |            | 1   |
| $-$   | $6/2-3$     |            |            | 0   |
| $4$   | $6/2-3$     | $4$        |            | 1   |
| $2$   | $6/2-3$     | $4$        | $2$        | 2   |
| $*$   | $6/2-3$     | $4*2$      |            | 1   |
| $+$   | $6/2-3+4*2$ |            |            | 0   |

</div>

***Representation***

We now consider the representation of both the stack and the expression.

- To simplify our task we assume that the expression contains only the binary operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%` and that the operands in the expression are single digit integers.
- This permits us to represent the expression as a character array.
- The operands are stored on a stack of type `int` until they are needed.
- We may use either of the representations of Sections 3.1 and 3.2. It is convenient to define the enumerated type `precedence`, which lists the operators by mnemonics, as below:

```c
typedef enum {
    lParen, rParen, plus, minus,
    times, divide, mod, eos, operand
} precedence; 
```

Although we will use it to process tokens (operators, operands, and parentheses) in this example, its real importance becomes evident when we translate infix expressions into postfix ones. Besides the usual operators, the enumerated type also includes an end-of-string(eos) operator.

## Evaluate a Postfix Expression

The function `eval` (Program 3.13) contains the code to evaluate a postfix expression.

```c
// Program 3.13

// evaluate a postfix expression, expr, maintained as a global variable.
// '\0' is the end of the expression.
// The stack and top of the stack are global variables.
// getToken is used to return the token type and the character symbol.
// Operands are assumed to be single Characters digits
int eval(void) {
    precedence token;
    char symbol;
    int op1, op2;
    int n = 0;  // counter for the expression string
    int top = -1;
    token = getToken(&symbol, &n);
    while (token != eos) {
        if (token == operand) {
            push(symbol - '0');
        } else {
            // pop two operands, perform operation, and
            // push result to the stack
            op2 = pop();
            op1 = pop();
            switch (token) {
                case plus:
                    push(op1 + op2);
                    break;
                case minus:
                    push(op1 - op2);
                    break;
                case times:
                    push(op1 * op2);
                    break;
                case divide:
                    push(op1 / op2);
                    break;
                case mod:
                    push(op1 % op2);
            }
        }
        token = getToken(&symbol, &n);
    }
    return pop();
}
```

Since an operand (`symbol`) is initially a character, we must convert it into a single digit integer.

- We use the statement, `symbol - '0'`, to accomplish this task.
- The statement takes the ASCII value of `symbol` and subtracts the ASCII value of `'0'`, which is 48, from it.

<div class="alert-example">

Suppose `symbol = '1'`.

- The character, `'1'`, has an ASCII value of 49.
- Therefore, the statement `symbol - '0'` produces as result the number 1.

</div>

- We use an auxiliary function, `getToken` (Program 3.14), to obtain tokens from the expression string.
- If the token is an operand, we convert it to a number and add it to the stack.
- Otherwise, we remove two operands from the stack, perform the specified operation, and place the result back on the stack.
- When we have reached the end of expression, we remove the result from the stack.

```c
// Program 3.14

// get the next token:
// Symbol is the character representation, which is returned.
// The token is represented by its enumerated value.
// The function returns the token.
precedence getToken(char *symbol, int* n) {
    *symbol = expr[(*n)++];
    switch (*symbol) {
        case '(': return lParen;
        case ')': return rParen;
        case '+': return plus;
        case '-': return minus;
        case '*': return times;
        case '/': return divide;
        case '%': return mod;
        case ' ': return eos;
        default : return operand;
    }
}
```

## Infix to Postfix

We can describe an algorithm for producing a postfix expression from an infix one as follows:

<div class="stepper">

- Fully parenthesize the expression.
- Move all binary operators so that they replace their corresponding right parentheses.
- Delete all parentheses.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

$a/b-c+d*e-a*c$ when fully parenthesized becomes:

$$
((((a/b)-c)+(d*e))-(a*c))
$$

Performing steps 2 and 3 gives:

$$
ab/c-de*+ac*-
$$

</div>

Although this algorithm works well when done by hand, it is inefficient on a computer because it requires two passes.

- The first pass reads the expression and parenthesizes it, while
- the second moves the operators.

Since the order of operands is the same in infix and postfix, we can form the postfix equivalent by scanning the infix expression left-to-right.

- During this scan, operands are passed to the output expression as they are encountered.
- However, the order in which the operators are output depends on their precedence. Since we must output the higher precedence operators first, we save operators until we know their correct placement. A stack is one way of doing this, but removing operators correctly is problematic.

Two examples illustrate the problem.

<div class="alert-example">

***Simple Expression***

Suppose we have the simple expression $a+b*c$, which yields $abc*+$ in postfix.

As the following table illustrates, the operands are output immediately, but the two operators need to be reversed.

| Token | stack[0] | stack[1] | stack[2] | Top | Output  |
| :---- | :------- | :------- | :------- | --: | :------ |
| a     |          |          |          |  -1 | $a$     |
| +     | +        |          |          |   0 | $a$     |
| b     | +        |          |          |   0 | $ab$    |
| *     | +        | *        |          |   1 | $ab$    |
| c     | +        | *        |          |   1 | $abc$   |
| eos   |          |          |          |  -1 | $abc*+$ |

In general, operators with higher precedence must be output before those with lower precedence. Therefore, we stack operators as long as the precedence of the operator at the top of the stack is less than the precedence of the incoming operator.

In this particular example, the unstacking occurs only when we reach the end of the expression. At this point, the two operators are removed. Since the operator with the higher precedence is on top of the stack, it is removed first.

</div>

<div class="alert-example">

***Parenthesized Expression***

Parentheses make the translation process more difficult because the equivalent postfix expression will be parenthesis-free.

We use as our example the expression $a*(b+c)*d$, which yields $abc+*d*$ in postfix. The following table shows the translation process.

| Token | stack[0] | stack[1] | stack[2] | Top | Output    |
| :---- | :------- | :------- | :------- | --: | :-------- |
| a     |          |          |          |  -1 | $a$       |
| *     | *        |          |          |   0 | $a$       |
| (     | *        | (        |          |   1 | $a$       |
| b     | *        | (        |          |   1 | $ab$      |
| +     | *        | (        | +        |   2 | $ab$      |
| c     | *        | (        | +        |   2 | $abc$     |
| )     | *        |          |          |   0 | $abc+$ |
| *     | *        |          |          |   0 | $abc+*$ |
| d     | *        |          |          |   0 | $abc+*d$ |
| eos   | *        |          |          |   0 | $abc+*d*$ |

Notice that we stack operators until we reach the right parenthesis. At this point we unstack until we reach the corresponding left parenthesis. We then delete the left parenthesis from the stack. (The right parenthesis is never put on the stack.)

This leaves us with only the $*d$ remaining in the infix expression. Since the two multiplications have equal precedences, one is output before the $d$, the second is placed on the stack and removed after the $d$ is output.

</div>

The analysis of the two examples suggests a precedence-based scheme for stacking and unstacking operators.

The left parenthesis complicates matters because it behaves like a low-precedence operator when it is on the stack, and a high-precedence one when it is not. It is placed in the stack whenever it is found in the expression, but it is unstacked only when its matching right parenthesis is found.

Thus, we have two types of precedence:

- an *in-stack precedence (isp)*.
- an *incoming precedence (icp)*.

The declarations that establish these precedences are:

```c
// isp and icp arrays -- index is value of precedence
// lParen, rParen, plus, minus, times, divide, mod, eos
int isp[] = {0, 19, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 0};
int icp[] = {20, 19, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 0};
```

Notice that we are now using the stack to store the mnemonic for the token. That is, the data type of the stack elements is *precedence*. Since the value of a variable of an enumerated type is simply the integer corresponding to the position of the value in the enumerated type, we can use the mnemonic as an index into the two arrays.

<div class="alert-example">

`isp[plus]` is translated into `isp[2]`, which gives us an in-stack precedence of 12.

</div>

![](./img/3.12.png ':figure Precedence hierarchy for C.')

The precedences are taken from Figure 3.12, but we have added precedences for the left and right parentheses and the eos marker.

- We give the right parenthesis an in-stack and incoming precedence (19) that is greater than the precedence of any operator in Figure 3.12.
- We give the left parenthesis an in-stack precedence of zero, and an incoming precedence (20) greater than that of the right parenthesis.
- In addition, because we want unstacking to occur when we reach the end of the string, we give the eos token a low precedence (0).

These precedences suggest that we remove an operator from the stack only if its in-stack precedence is greater than or equal to the incoming precedence of the new operator.

The function ``postfix`` (Program 3.15) converts an infix expression into a postfix one using the process just discussed. This function invokes a function, `printToken`, to print out the character associated with the enumerated type. That is, `printToken` reverses the process used in `getToken`.

```c
// Program 3.15

// output the postfix of the expression.
// The expression string, the stack, and top are global
void postfix(void) {
    char symbol;
    precedence;
    int n = 0;
    int top = 0;  // place eos on stack
    stack[0] = eos;

    for (token = getToken(&symbol, &n);
         token != eos;
         token = getToken(&symbol, &n)) {

        if (token == operand) {
            printf("%c", symbol);
        } else if (token == rParen) {
            // unstack tokens until left parenthesis
            while (stack[top] != lParen) {
                printToken(pop());
            }
            pop();  // discard the left parenthesis
        } else {
            // remove and print symbols whose isp is
            // greater than or equal to the current token’s icp
            while (isp[stack[top]] >= icp[token]) {
                printToken(pop());
            }
            push(token);
        }
    }
    while ((token = pop()) != eos) {
        printToken(token);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

***Analysis of `postfix`:***

Let $n$ be the number of tokens in the expression. $\Theta (n)$ time is spent extracting tokens and outputting them. Besides this, time is spent in the two while loops. The total time spent here is $\Theta (n)$ as the number of tokens that get stacked and unstacked is linear in $n$. So, the complexity of function `postfix` is $\Theta (n)$.

# Stacks

A **stack** is an ordered list in which insertions (also called pushes and adds) and deletions (also called pops and removes) are made at one end called the **top**.

Given a Stack $S = (a_0,\ \cdots ,\ a_{n-1})$, we Say that

- $a_0$ is the bottom element.
- $a_{n-1}$ is the top element.
- $a_i$ is on top of element $a_{i - 1},\ 0 < i < n$. (後項會在前項的上面)

Since the last element inserted into a stack is the first element removed, a stack is also known as a *Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)* list.

The restrictions on the stack imply that if we add the elements $A, B, C, D, E$ to the stack, in that order, then $E$ is the first element we delete from the stack. Figure 3.1 illustrates this sequence of operations.

## Example: System Stack

Before we discuss the stack ADT, we look at a special stack, called the **system stack**, that is used by a program at run-time to process function calls.

Whenever a function is invoked, the program creates a structure, referred to as an **activation record** or a **stack frame**, and places it on top of the system stack.

Initially, the activation record for the invoked function contains only a pointer to the previous stack frame and a return address.

1. The *previous stack frame pointer* points to the stack frame of the invoking function,
2. while the *return address* contains the location of the statement to be executed after the function terminates.

Since only one function executes at any given time, the function whose stack frame is on top of the system stack is chosen.

- If this function invokes another function, the local variables, except those declared static, and the parameters of the invoking function (原函式) are added to its stack frame.
- A new stack frame is then created for the invoked function (被呼叫的函式) and placed on top of the system stack.
- When this function terminates, its stack frame is removed and the processing of the invoking function, which is again on top of the stack, continues. A simple example illustrates this process.

<div class="alert-example">

Assume that we have a `main` function that invokes function `a1`.

![](./img/3.2.png ':figure System stack after function call.')

- Figure 3.2(a) shows the system stack before `a1` is invoked;
- Figure 3.2(b) shows the system stack after `a1` has been invoked.

Frame pointer `fp` is a pointer to the current stack frame. The system also maintains separately a stack pointer, `sp`, which we have not illustrated.

</div>

Since all functions are stored similarly in the system stack, it makes no difference if the invoking function calls itself. That is, a recursive call requires no special strategy; the run-time program simply creates a new stack frame for each recursive call. However, recursion can consume a significant portion of the memory allocated to the system stack; it could consume the entire available memory.

## Stack ADT

The easiest way to implement this ADT is by using a one-dimensional array, say, `stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE]`, where `MAX_STACK_SIZE` is the maximum number of entries.

- The first, or bottom, element of the stack is stored in `stack[0]`, the second in `stack [1]`, and the ith in `stack[i—1]`.
- Associated with the array is a variable, `top`, which points to the top element in the stack. Initially, top is set to -1 to denote an empty stack.

Given this representation, we can implement the operations in ADT 3.1 as follows.

```algorithm
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{ADT Stack}
\begin{algorithmic}

\state $\textbf{objects:}$
\state a finite ordered list with zero or more elements. \\\\

\state $\textbf{functions:}$
\state  for all stack $\in$ Stack, \\
        $\hspace{2.65em}$ item $\in$ element, \\
        $\hspace{2.65em}$ maxStackSize $\in$ positive integer.

\state \\

\function{CreateS}{maxStackSize}
    \return an empty stack whose maximum size is maxStackSize.
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{IsEmpty}{stack}
    \if{stack == \call{CreateS}{maxStackSize}}
        \return TRUE
    \else
        \return FALSE
    \endIf
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{IsFull}{stack, maxStackSize}
    \if{(number of elements in stack == maxStackSize)}
        \return TRUE
    \else
        \return FALSE
    \endIf
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{Push}{stack, item}
    \if{\call{IsFull}{stack}}
        \state \call{stackFull}{}
    \else
        \state insert item into top of stack.
        \return stack
    \endIf
\endFunction

\state \\

\function{Pop}{stack}
    \if{$\lnot$\call{IsEmpty}{stack}}
        \state $\textbf{remove}$ and $\textbf{return}$ the element at the top of the stack.
    \endIf
\endFunction

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Notice that we have specified that element is a structure that consists of only a key field. Ordinarily, we would not create a structure with a single field. However, we use element in this and subsequent chapters as a template whose fields we may add to or modify to meet the requirements of our application.

```c
#define MAX_STACK_SIZE 100  // maximum stack size

typedef struct {
    int key;
    // other fields
} element;

// CreateS
element stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE];
int top = -1;

bool IsEmpty() {
    return top < 0;
}

bool IsFull() {
    return top >= MAX_STACK_SIZE - 1;
}
```

The `IsEmpty` and `IsFull` operations are simple, and we will implement them directly in the `push` (Program 3.1) and `pop` (Program 3.2) functions. Each of these functions assumes that the variables `stack` and `top` are global. The functions are short and require little explanation.

***Function `push`***

Function `push` checks to see if the stack is full.

- If it is, it calls `stackFull` (Program 3.3), which prints an error message and terminates execution.
- When the stack is not full, we increment `top` and assign `item` to `stack[top]`.

```c
// Program 3.1
// add an item to the global stack
void push(element item) {
    if (IsFull()) {
        stackFull();
    }
    stack[++top] = item;
}
```

```c
// Program 3.3
void stackFull () {
    fprintf(stderr, "Stack is full, cannot add element.");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

***Function `pop`***

Implementation of the `pop` operation parallels that of the `push` operation. The code of Program 3.2 assumes that the `stackEmpty` function prints an error message and returns an `item` of type `element` with a key field that contains an error code.

Typical function calls would be `push(item)`; and `item = pop();`.

```c
// Program 3.2
// delete and return the top element from the stack
element Pop() {
    if (IsEmpty()) {  // IsEmpty()
        return stackEmpty();  // returns an error key 
    }
    return stack[top--];
}
```

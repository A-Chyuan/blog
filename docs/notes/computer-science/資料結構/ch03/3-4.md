# Circular Queues Using Dynamic Arrays

Suppose that a dynamically allocated array is used to hold the queue elements.

- Let `capacity` be the number of positions in the array `queue`.
- To add an element to a full queue, we must first increase the size of this array using a function such as `realloc`.
- As with dynamically allocated stacks, we use array doubling.

However, it isn’t sufficient to simply double array size using `realloc`.

<div class="alert-example">

![](./img/3.7.png ':figure Doubling queue capacity.')

- Consider the full queue of Figure 3.7(a). This figure shows a queue with seven elements in an array whose capacity is 8.
- To visualize array doubling when a circular queue is used, it is better to flatten out the array as in Figure 3.7(b).
- Figure 3.7(c) shows the array after array doubling by `realloc`.
- To get a proper circular queue configuration, <mark>we must slide the elements in the right segment (i.e., elements A and B) to the right end of the array</mark> as in Figure 3.7(d).
- The array doubling and the slide to the right together copy at most `2 * capacity - 2` elements. The number of elements copied can be limited to `capacity - 1` by customizing array doubling code so as to obtain the configuration of Figure 3.7(e).

This configuration may be obtained as follows:

- Create a new array `newQueue` of twice the capacity.
- Copy the second segment (i.e., the elements `queue[front + 1]` through `queue[capacity - 1]`) to positions in `newQueue` beginning at 0.
- Copy the first segment (i.e., the elements `queue[0]` through `queue[rear]`) to positions in `newQueue` beginning at `capacity - front - 1`.

Program 3.9 gives the code to add to a circular queue using a dynamically allocated array.

```c
// Program 3.9
// add an item to the queue
void add(element item) {
    if (front == (rear + 1) % capacity) {
        queueFull();  // double capacity
    }
    rear = (rear + 1) % capacity;
    queue[rear] = item;
}
```

!> 這邊我重新改寫了 `copy` 與 Program 3.10 `queueFull`。

Program 3.10 gives the code for `queueFull`.

- The function `copy(a, b, c)` copies elements from memory locations `a` through `b` (inclusive) into the target array starting at location c.
- Program 3.10 obtains the configuration of Figure 3.7(e).

```c
// Program 3.10
// allocate an array with twice the capacity
void queueFull() {
    element newQueue;
    MALLOC(newQueue, 2 * capacity * sizeof(element));

    // copy from queue to newQueue
    int start = (front + 1) % capacity;
    if (start <= rear) {
        // no wrap around: the queue elements are stored contiguously
        copy(queue + start, queue + rear, newQueue);
    } else {
        // queue wraps around
        // 例如 Figure 3.7 (c)
        copy(queue + start, queue + capacity - 1, newQueue);    // 後段
        copy(queue, queue + rear, newQueue + capacity - start); // 前段
    }

    // switch to newQueue
    front = 2 * capacity - 1;   // 資料從 newQueue[0] 開始，front 在尾端
    rear = capacity - 2;        // queue 中共有 capacity - 1 個元素
                                // 所以最後一個元素是在 newQueue[capacity - 2]
    capacity *= 2;
    free(queue);
    queue = newQueue;
}
```

# Introduction

A **number system** (or numeral system) defines how a number can be represented using distinct symbols. A number can be represented differently in different systems.

<div class="alert-example">

- The two numbers $(2A)_{16}$ and $(52)_8$ both refer to the same quantity, $(42)_{10}$, but their representations are different
- This is the same as using the words *cheval* (French) and *equus* (Latin) to refer to the same entity, a *horse*.

</div>

Several number systems have been used in the past and can be categorized into two groups:

- **Positional systems**
- **Nonpositional systems**

Our main goal is to discuss the positional number systems, but we also give examples of nonpositional systems.
